"Socio-Technical Innovation Bundles for Agri-Food Systems Transformation","This editorial piece shares key recommendations from an expert panel from Nature Sustainability and the Atkinson Center for Sustainability on innovations to build sustainable, equitable, inclusive food value chains.
The paper explores options for driving systemic change in agri-food systems. The expert panellists suggest bundling innovations. A socio-technical bundle is a mix of science and technology advances, properly contextualized, combined with specific institutional or policy adaptations. All actors along the agri-food value chains are vital to the success of innovations and play a role in transforming agri-food systems. ","Nature Sustainability","Barrett, Christopher B., Tim Benton, Jessica Fanzo, et al.",0,"Read the paper here-https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-00672-5",,,Other,"Poverty reduction and livelihoods|Nutrition, health and food security",,,Global,"Innovations within the supply chain","SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 2 - Zero Hunger",,,"Journal article",1,"2023-07-06 05:38:10",Vi.Nguyen,2020-12-10T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2477,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2477,no,
"The State of Food and Agriculture 2021: Making agrifood systems more resilient to shocks and stresses","The State of Food and Agriculture 2021 report from FAO presents country-level indicators of the resilience of agrifood systems. The indicators measure the robustness of primary production and food availability, as well as physical and economic access to food. 
The report analyses the vulnerabilities of food supply chains and how rural households cope with risks and shocks. It discusses options to minimize trade-offs that building resilience may have with efficiency and inclusivity. The aim is to offer guidance on policies to enhance food supply chain resilience, support livelihoods in the agrifood system and, in the face of disruption, ensure sustainable access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to all.",FAO,FAO,0,"Read the report here-https://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/cb4476en",,,Other,"Poverty reduction and livelihoods|Nutrition, health and food security",,,Global,"Innovations in the enabling environment|Innovations within the supply chain","SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 10 - Reduce Inequalities",,,"Research report",1,"2023-07-06 05:09:39",Vi.Nguyen,2021-07-06T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2476,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2476,no,
"What's Cooking: Digital Transformation of the Agrifood System","The digital agriculture revolution holds a promise to build an agriculture and food system that is efficient, environmentally sustainable, and equitable, one that can help deliver the Sustainable Development Goals. The change is driven by the ability to collect, use, and analyze massive amounts of machine-readable data about practically every aspect of the value chain, and by the emergence of digital platforms disrupting existing business models. The success of the digital transformation, however, is not guaranteed as the risks it brings are numerous, including those related to data governance and inadequate competition within and between digital platforms. 
This report investigates how digital technologies can accelerate the transformation of the agrifood system. It also identifies a key role for the public sector in maximizing the benefits of this process while minimizing its risks, through enabling an innovation ecosystem featuring open datasets, digital platforms, digital entrepreneurship, digital payment systems, and digital skills and encouraging equitable technology adoption.","World Bank Group","Kateryna Schroeder, Julian Lampietti, and Ghada Elabed",0,"Read the report here-https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/e9b250b5-f560-523a-9328-ec90e8b2a29a",,,Other,"Nutrition, health and food security",,,Global,"Innovations within the supply chain: Value chain infrastructure|Innovations in the enabling environment|Product or farm level: Farm level technology / agronomic practices (GAPs)","SDG 2 - Zero Hunger|SDG 1 - No Poverty",,,"Research report",1,"2023-07-06 04:29:20",Vi.Nguyen,2021-03-16T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2473,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2473,no,
"Global Market Report: Palm oil prices and sustainability","Palm oil development in Indonesia and Malaysia—the top two producing countries—has led to significant forest loss over the last 30 years. The deforestation and land-use changes that often occur during palm oil cultivation are some of the leading causes of climate change—yet the sector is increasingly vulnerable to its impacts.
With rising production costs, limited negotiation power, and a lack of access to finance and quality inputs to contend with, many oil palm farmers in developing regions are left struggling to earn a living.

"Decent and Productive Work in Agriculture","Agriculture is an important source of employment and income, particularly in developing countries. Yet agricultural workers often face decent work deficits, working for low wages and incomes under poor and sometimes hazardous conditions, and lacking the means to effectively address their situation. Achieving decent work and improving productivity in agriculture are key to reducing poverty and stimulating economic growth in rural areas. Improving the quantity and quality of jobs, promoting rights at work, extending social protection, and strengthening rural workers’ organizations are crucial for achieving decent work and improving agricultural productivity.
This policy guidance note from the International Labour Organization (ILO)profiles approaches for addressing the substantial decent work deficits in agriculture, with special attention to the most vulnerable. It focuses on much-needed action in the areas of skills development and the realization of core rights and protections for agricultural workers.","International Labour Organization (ILO)","International Labour Organization (ILO)",1,"Read the policy guidance here-https://www.ilo.org/global/topics/economic-and-social-development/rural-development/WCMS_437173/lang--en/index.htm",,,Other,"Poverty reduction and livelihoods|Gender equality, youth and social inclusion",,,Global,,"SDG 2 - Zero Hunger|SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 5 - Gender Equality",,"Primary production","Policy brief",1,"2023-06-29 05:58:00",Vi.Nguyen,2019-11-21T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2465,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2465,no,

"Rethinking Our Food Systems: A Guide for Multi-Stakeholder Collaboration","Food systems involve complex challenges, which call for a systemic, multi-level and multi-stakeholder participatory approach for addressing interrelated issues across economic, social and environmental dimensions: the so-called food systems approach.
Therefore, multi-stakeholder collaboration needs to be an essential pillar of the food systems approach and the transition to sustainable food systems. Against this background, UNEP, FAO and UNDP jointly created this guide to consolidate learnings and tools gathered from within and beyond the three agencies to contribute to the growing canon of knowledge on how to improve multi-stakeholder collaboration for sustainable food systems transformation. The aim of the guide is to support those interested or engaged in convening, implementing, facilitating or supporting a multi-stakeholder initiative that contributes to the sustainable transformation of food systems, at different levels.","UNEP, FAO and UNDP","Carmen Torres Ledezma, Elena Ilie, Siobhan Kelly, Pablo Garcia-Campos, Costanza Rizzo, Kathleen Wood and Marina Bortoletti.",1,,,,Other,"Nutrition, health and food security|Poverty reduction and livelihoods",,,Global,,"SDG 2 - Zero Hunger|SDG 5 - Gender Equality|SDG 13 - Climate Action",,,Guideline,1,"2023-06-29 05:45:11",Vi.Nguyen,2021-06-21T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2463,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2463,no,

"Standards and Poverty Reduction: State of Sustainability Initiatives Review","How can voluntary sustainability standards (VSSs) contribute to poverty reduction for smallholder farmers? The SSI Review: Standards and Poverty Reduction examines VSSs and provides recommendations to VSS bodies, value chain actors, and governments to reduce poverty. There are an estimated 500 million smallholder farmer families globally, many of whom make up a large portion of the world’s poor. These farmers work small plots of land, often earning and producing enough to survive but not enough to rise out of poverty. Widespread poverty alleviation cannot be achieved without uplifting smallholder farmers, and this report from IISD’s State of Sustainability Initiatives examines how sustainability standards can contribute to reducing poverty among farmers. This report presents findings on the examination of 13 widely adopted (VSSs) and reviews existing evidence—all to better understand how VSSs can improve the three dimensions of poverty reduction: access to resources; opportunities and choice; and power and voice. It also includes an assessment of the factors determining smallholder farmer access to VSS-compliant markets based on 57 interviews with actors in six countries from a joint field study by IISD and UNCTAD.","International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD)","Elder, S.| Wilkings, A.| Larrea, C. | Elamin, N. | de Cordoba, S.F.",0,"Read the paper here-https://www.evidensia.eco/resources/1266/standards-and-poverty-reduction-state-of-sustainability-initiatives-review/",,,"Evidensia platform","Poverty reduction and livelihoods",,"Synthesis paper",Global,,"SDG 12 - Responsible Production and Consumption",,,"Research report",1,"2023-06-23 11:51:01",Carla,2021-12-05T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2455,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2455,no,
"Scaling modern technology or scaling exclusion? The socio-political dynamics of accessing in malt barley innovation in two highland communities in Southern Ethiopia","In this article we explore whether and how the dynamics of access shape the scaling of modern agricultural technologies. It is based on the experience of an agricultural research for development (AR4D) project called CASCAPE, which aims to validate and scale agricultural best practices for smallholder farmers in Ethiopia. The socio-political dynamics of external interventions are often taken for granted contextual factors in AR4D projects. By contrast, this article takes this context as the point of departure for its analysis. The aim of this in-depth case study is to unpack the concept of access as condition for scaling of agricultural technologies. We identify and analyse the mechanisms that determine access to the various components of a malt barley technology package which was introduced in two highland communities in southern Ethiopia (and later ‘scaled’ to a range of other communities). Our research approach is technographic, implying that we consider the technology to contain both material and social components. The findings suggest that social and clan-based exchange mechanisms (such as clan-based loyalty, reciprocity and vertical accountability) are often rendered invisible even though they are of critical importance in governing access to the material and social components of modern agricultural technologies. Ignoring this socio-political context in the malt barley interventions resulted in an unintended scaling effect in terms of widening the social and economic gap between a few better off farmers and a larger group of poor farmers. The paper thus provides evidence that the socio-political dynamics of access to technology can have an important influence on its wide spread application and may complicate efforts to scale the uptake of technology. Paying more attention to such processes would help to improve the effectiveness of AR4D efforts.",Elsevier,"de Roo, N.|Almekinders, C.|Leeuwis, C.|Tefera, T.",0,"Read the paper here-https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X18309843",,,Other,"Poverty reduction and livelihoods|Household income: farm income",,"Empirical study",Ethiopia,,"SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 2 - Zero Hunger|SDG 10 - Reduce Inequalities",Crops,"Primary production: crops","Journal article",1,"2023-05-31 11:06:11",Carla,2019-08-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2430,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2430,no,ETH
"Impact tracking: A practitioner-developed approach to scaling agricultural innovation in Ethiopia","This paper argues for more creativity and flexibility in agricultural research for development (AR4D) scaling and impact evaluation in complex contexts. While acknowledging the importance of setting reasonable end-of-project targets and outcomes, we argue that the achievement of outcomes and impacts, particularly in complex contexts, requires adaptive management and acknowledgment that significant positive outcomes and impacts may occur after the project funding cycle is complete. The paper presents a practitioner-developed approach to scaling AR4D innovations called Impact Tracking (IT). We illustrate IT in practice by presenting three case studies from Ethiopia in which IT proved crucial to achieving impact. The paper concludes by drawing lessons from the case studies and discussing what implications IT may have for development practitioners.","International Water Management Institute","Child, K.|Desta, G.|Douthwaite, B.|Haileslassie, A.|van Rooyen, A.|Tamene, L.|Uhlenbrook, S.",0,"Read the paper here-https://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/publications/wle-legacy-series/wle-legacy-series-1/",,,Other,"Poverty reduction and livelihoods|Household income: farm income",,"Empirical study",Ethiopia,,"SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 2 - Zero Hunger|SDG 10 - Reduce Inequalities",Crops,"Primary production: crops","Journal article",1,"2023-05-31 10:52:50",Carla,2021-01-30T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2429,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2429,no,ETH

"Towards environmental sustainability: the role of certification in the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices among Ghanaian mango farmers","The role of market interventions like certification in promoting climate action has received little attention in policy and academic circles. This study used a multivariate probit model (MVP) to analyze the factors that influence farmers’ adoption of multiple climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices. An endogenous treatment effects (eteffects) regression was used to estimate the impact of certification on the adoption of different CSA practices. The study found that age, education, farm size, access to extension services and storage facilities influenced the adoption of different CSA practices. After accounting for endogeneity, we found that the adoption of certification reduces the likelihood that farmers will use inorganic fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides by about 50, 38 and 23 percentage points, respectively. We conclude that certification has the potential to reduce the adoption of agronomic practices that contribute to climate change.","Taylor and Francis Online","Akrong, R.|Akorsu, A.D.|Jha, P.| Agyenim, J.B.",0,"Read the paper here-https://www.evidensia.eco/resources/1353/towards-environmental-sustainability-the-role-of-certification-in-the-adoption-of-climate-smart-agricultural-practices-among-ghanaian-mango-farmers/",,,"Evidensia platform","Climate mitigation: climate-smart agriculture",,"Empirical study","Africa: Western Africa|Ghana","Product or farm level: Product certification","SDG 13 - Climate Action",Crops,"Primary production: crops","Journal article",1,"2023-05-23 07:42:45",Carla,2023-03-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2412,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2412,no,|GHA
"Price interventions as a part of living Income strategies: lessons learned from piloting a price premium mechanism for basmati rice farmers in Pakistan","This Oxfam discussion paper discusses a pilot project in Pakistan aimed at improving the income of small-scale farmers who grow basmati rice in Punjab province. The project focused on developing a mechanism for transferring a premium payment directly to farmers without affecting the cost for retailers or consumers. The intervention is reported to have successfully closed the income gap for vulnerable small-scale farmers, but it requires other complementary measures. The project shows that increasing prices is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of various factors. The paper identifies eight key factors for the success of price interventions and offers recommendations for stakeholders interested in designing and implementing similar interventions.","Oxfam GB","Mira, A.",0,"Read the paper here-https://www.evidensia.eco/resources/2987/price-interventions-as-a-part-of-living-income-strategies-lessons-learned-from-piloting-a-price-premium-mechanism-for-basmati-rice-farmers-in-pakistan/",,,"Evidensia platform","Household income","Grains: rice","Synthesis paper",Pakistan,"Product or farm level","SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth",Crops,"Primary production: crops","Research report",1,"2023-05-23 07:25:57",Carla,2023-03-03T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2411,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2411,no,PAK

"Are farmers’ climate change adaptation strategies understated? Evidence from two communities in northern Ethiopian highlands","Research and policy analyses of climate change adaptation in Africa are often centre to examine adjustments in agricultural operations. This mainly bases on a misconception that rural households merely depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. This research aimed at positioning livelihood (farm and non-farm activities) as the centre of climate adaptation strategies to better understand rural households’ adaptation strategic options and capacities, using two rural communities in the Northern highlands of Ethiopia.
The result showed that rural households have broader options both in farm and non-farm strategies for combating adverse climate condition than previously reported.

"Working with informality: Constructive ways to transform food systems","Many people in low-income countries rely on informal food systems for food and livelihoods. But informality puts food systems outside — or partly outside — the governance of states and value chains. This working paper explores the challenges involved in reversing decades of underinvestment, and why focusing too closely on formalisation may price out or remove informal food systems — and those who depend on them — from the market. Instead, development organisations engaged in food systems transformation should constructively engage with informal agrifood markets and actors, recognising what informal food systems already do well and focusing on building partnerships based on common cause, to build trust.","IIED’s Shaping Sustainable Markets Group","Vorley, B.",1,"Read the paper here -https://snv.org/update/beyond-formality-how-embracing-informal-markets-can-drive-inclusive-economic-growth",,,Other,"Youth employment|Poverty reduction and livelihoods|Women's empowerment|Income and employment opportunities: employment|Nutrition, health and food security",,"Synthesis paper",Global,"Innovations within the supply chain","SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 10 - Reduce Inequalities",,,"Research report",1,"2023-05-17 08:06:15",Rita.Mendez,2023-05-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2407,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2407,no,
"Digital tools and agricultural market transformation in Africa: Why are they not at scale yet, and what will it take to get there?","Despite enthusiasm for the potential of digital innovations to transform agricultural markets in Africa, progress made thus far has been limited to small-scale experiments that often fail to scale up. Realizing the full potential of digital innovations – tools, technologies, applications, and services – in Africa requires not just further development of these solutions at meaningful scales, but also more nuanced evidence from both successful and unsuccessful scaling efforts. This paper reviews the conceptual and empirical evidence on the transformative potential of digital innovations for African agricultural markets with an in-depth examination of solutions that have been rolled out to date in the continent. Specifically, the review addresses the following questions: (i) how can digital innovations improve the functioning of agricultural markets in Africa? (ii) what explains the apparent disconnect of most pilots to scale-ups? (iii) what is required to realize their full potential? and (iv) what are the emerging risks and opportunities associated with digital innovations for agricultural marketing? Although our review of the landscape and literature on market-focused digital innovations in Africa identifies several reasons to remain optimistic, the prevailing disconnect between pilots and scale-ups merits further evaluation. In particular, there is a need for more systematic assessments of both successes and failures at both the piloting and scaling stages.",ScienceDirect,"Gashaw T. Abate, Kibrom A.

"The role of market concentration in the agrifood industry","The role of market concentration and potential market power exertion in the agri-food industry is a topic of longstanding interest and concern to policymakers, stakeholders, and researchers. This study provides a comprehensive overview of recent trends in market concentration upstream, midstream, and downstream the agri-food industry at the global, regional, and country level, and assesses how and to what extent concentration could be affecting market conduct and performance of food systems in developed and developing countries. The analysis additionally discusses, to the extent detectable, implications of concentration, including vertical and horizontal integration that favor concentration, for food security and nutrition and environmental sustainability. While market concentration in the agri-food industry has increased across most segments, the evidence on market power exertion is inconclusive. Several knowledge and data gaps are identified and additional research is necessary to derive more general conclusions and policy recommendations.","International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)","Hernandez, Manuel A., Espinoza, Alvaro, Berrospi, Maria Lucia, Deconinck, Koen, Swinnen, Johan, Vos, Rob",0,"Explore the full paper-https://ebrary.ifpri.org/utils/getfile/collection/p15738coll2/id/136567/filename/136780.pdf",,,Other,"Nutrition, health and food security: Dietary diversity",,"Empirical study",Global,"Innovations within the supply chain","SDG 1 - No Poverty",,,"Research report",1,"2023-03-16 09:33:28",soonho.kim,2023-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2316,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2316,no,
"Border carbon adjustments: Should production or consumption be taxed?","Border Carbon Adjustment (BCAs) may play an important role in lowering the economic costs of greenhouse gas mitigation and in overcoming political-economy constraints on use of carbon taxes or equivalent measures. A carbon tax plus a full BCA (CTBA) could deal with the competitiveness challenges arising from carbon taxes by using the WTO’s National Treatment principle to apply equal levies on domestic production and on imports, and by symmetrically rebating the carbon tax on exports in the manner of a VAT export rebate. This approach would shift the base for carbon taxation from output to consumption and intermediate input use and potentially lower the cost of achieving reductions in emissions. It would avoid the massive measurement and compliance problems associated with BCAs based on foreign emission intensities. By contrast, proposals for import-only BCAs would distort prices of importables relative to exportables, create competitiveness concerns in export industries, generate economic waste and likely create highly divisive trade conflicts and deterioration in the terms of trade for developing countries.","European University Institute","Martin, W.",0,"Explore the full paper-https://cadmus.eui.eu/handle/1814/74039",,,Other,"Climate mitigation: GHG emissions",,"Empirical study",Global,"Innovations in the enabling environment: Support and trade policies","SDG 13 - Climate Action",,,"Journal article",1,"2023-03-16 09:26:08",soonho.kim,2022-02-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2315,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2315,no,
"The impacts of price insulation on world wheat markets during the 2022 food price crisis","This paper begins with a survey of recent commodity price developments that highlights the magnitude of this price surge and identifies the rapid rise in wheat prices as a key element. The analysis in this paper focuses on the extent to which domestic markets are insulated from these changes and on the resulting impacts on world prices. An econometric analysis using error-correction models finds stable long-term relationships between world wheat prices and most domestic prices of wheat and wheat products, but with considerable variation across countries in the rate of price transmission. A case study of the price shocks during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine food price crisis finds that price insulation roughly doubled the overall increase in world wheat prices and raised their volatility both during periods of price increase and price decline.","Wiley Online Library","Martin, W., Minot, N.",0,"Explore the full paper-https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8489.12498",,,Other,"Agribusiness profitability: output prices","Grains: wheat","Empirical study",Global,"Innovations in the enabling environment: Price support","SDG 1 - No Poverty",Crops,Post-harvest,"Journal article",1,"2023-03-16 09:12:58",soonho.kim,2022-11-10T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2314,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2314,no,
"Solar-powered cold-storage and agrifood market modernization in Nigeria","Modern cooling technologies that utilize renewable energy sources have been increasingly recognized as promising tools to address various challenges emerging in progressively complex agrifood systems in developing countries. Knowledge gaps about the actual impacts of these technologies in developing countries remain, especially in Africa south of the Sahara (SSA). This study fills this knowledge gap by providing evidence from the evaluation of recent interventions in northeast Nigeria in which seven small solar-powered cold storages were installed across seven horticulture markets. Combinations of difference-in-difference (DID) and variants of propensity-score-based methods suggest that cold storage significantly increased horticulture sales volumes and revenues of market agents. Back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate that increased net revenues for market agents may be sufficiently large to recoup cold storage investments and operating costs within a reasonable time frame. Using cold storage also reduced the share of food loss. It lengthened the products' shelf-life while raising prices received by market agents and farmers, which were associated with improved product quality, expanded value-adding activities by market agents, and increased use of advance payments.","Wiley Online Library","Takeshima, H., Yamauchi, F., Edeh, H., Hernandez, M.

"Solar-based irrigation bundle profile and scaling in Ghana","There are solutions to sustainable intensification, irrigation technologies, and water management under changing weather and climate conditions; they are just not available to smallholder farmers and vulnerable groups on a large scale. Scaling these solutions, therefore, needs to develop bundles of best- fit solutions to diversify farming and farmer conditions and adapt them to the context of irrigated farming. Throughout the action research process, solar-based irrigation bundle (SBIB) has been scaled in Upper East, Upper West, Northern, Northeast, and Savanah region, Ghana since January 2020. SBIB offers solar- powered irrigation pumps and pay-as-you-go and pay-as-you-own (PAYGO/PAYOWN) financing services to smallholder farmers in combination with tailoring their business models to different client segments (ability to pay, frequency, amount) to lower the barrier for upfront investment cost, enabling solar irrigation adoption and enhancing productivity and income throughout the year. This SBIB profile consists of three components: 1) bundle components and characteristics, 2) assessing the scalability and scaling potential of the bundle, and 3) developing scaling strategies
This bundle includes various innovations, services, and scaling actions:
- Core innovations: solar-powered irrigation pumps (SPIPs); PAYGO/PAYOWN financial services to lower the initial cost of the pump; And tailored business models to different client segments
- Services: Sale and service networks for market linkages; Digital financial payment (MoMo MTN); De-risk investment from development partners (e.g., GIZ with 40% for male farmers and 50% for female farmers) subsidy for the PAYGO/PAYOWN SPIPs investment; and Internship with and for filling in the private sector partners’ knowledge and human resource gaps
- Scaling actions: Market segmentation for the PAYGO/PAYOWN SPIPs; demand-supply linkage workshop and services; and multi-stakeholder dialogues on scaling small scale irrigation (SSI) to leverage the private sector engagement and multi-sector investment
To scale this bundle, a demand-supply linkage pathway was co-developed with actors in the irrigated vegetable value chain. The pathway consists of four components: 1) establish sales and service networks, 2) increase the private sector’s visibility and outreach in the regions, 3) capitalize on the sale of PAY-OWN PS2 solar-powered pumps, and 4) facilitate environmental and social sustainability and inclusivity of scaling solar-based irrigation in the region. A multi-actor partnership was established between private sector partners (Pumptech Ghana, Tech2 Ghana), research partners (International Water Management Institute – IWMI), Government Partners (Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Regional Agricultural Department –- MOFA; Rural Development Bank); and Development partners (Green Energy Project and Green People's Energy Project - GIZ).
The scaling readiness of SBIB is at level 9―Proven innovation bundle―because the bundle and its bundling process have proven certain impact indicators in Ghana and scaled to Ethiopia and Mali. One private sector partner in Ghana increased their sale of solar-powered irrigation pumps up to 80% in 2021. The estimated annual investment in 2022 from the private sector partners is US$500,000 of which to the smallholder farmer segment is US$250,000. Based on the outcome of the partnership, one million US$ for impact investment into smallholder solar-based irrigation has been mobilized jointly by the Shell and Lorentz foundations to target Lorentz's distributors in Sub-Sahara Africa.
Scaling of SBIB contributes to different development outcomes such as SDG 1 (e.g., eradicate extreme poverty); SDG 2 (e.g., end hunger and all forms of malnutrition, double agricultural productivity, and incomes of small-scale food producers, ensure sustainable food production systems and producer support); SDG 5 (e.g., give women equal rights to economic resources, enhance the use of ICTs to empower women); SDG8 (e.g., higher productivity through upgrading and innovation and higher value- added, support decent job creation and entrepreneurship, and enhance youth employment opportunities); SDG 10 (e.g., reduce inequality); SDG12 (e.g., reduce food loss and waste); and SDG (e.g., take urgent action to combat climate change).","International Water Management Institute (IWMI)","Minh, Thai Thi,  Ofosu, A.",0,"Explore the full paper-https://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Other/PDF/solar-based_irrigation_bundle_profile_and_scaling_in_ghana.pdf",,,Other,"Climate mitigation: renewable energy",,"Empirical study",Ghana,"Innovations in the enabling environment: Infrastructure development","SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 2 - Zero Hunger|SDG 5 - Gender Equality|SDG 10 - Reduce Inequalities|SDG 12 - Responsible Production and Consumption",Services,"Primary production|Pre-harvest: energy|Post-harvest: logistics","Research report",1,"2023-03-06 14:57:58",soonho.kim,2022-12-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2304,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2304,no,GHA
"Analyzing the enabling environment to enhance the scaling of irrigation and water management technologies: a tool for implementers","Agricultural innovation scaling approaches tend to be empirical but do not sufficiently take into account the complex realities of ‘softer elements’ such as people, supply chains, markets, financing mechanisms, policies and regulations, professional knowledge, power relations, incentives and history. As a consequence, scaling initiatives often do not produce the desired impacts and, in some instances, may even produce undesirable impacts.
Designing scaling strategies that are adaptive to context and available resources requires an understanding of the enabling environment in which the scaling processes are embedded. This can be achieved by conducting an analysis to identify enablers and hinderers influencing farmers’ adoption of irrigation and water management technologies and introducing measures to ensure success. The tool described in this working paper provides implementers with a structured guide to carrying out this analysis in a specific context.","International Water Management Institute (IWMI)","Minh, Thai Thi, Zwart, Sander, Appoh, Richard, Schmitter, Petra",0,"Explore the full paper-https://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Working_Papers/working/wor197.pdf",,,Other,"Poverty reduction and livelihoods",,"Empirical study",Global,"Innovations in the enabling environment","SDG 1 - No Poverty",Crops,"Primary production",Tool,1,"2023-03-06 11:54:09",soonho.kim,2021-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2303,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2303,no,
"Land use decisions: By whom and to whose benefit? A serious game to uncover dynamics in farm land allocation at household level in Northern Ghana","Globally, 38% of the land area is agricultural land, of which 45% are located on drylands, mainly in Africa and Asia, constituting the basis for about 60% of the world’s food production. Of all farms worldwide, 83% are smallholder farm systems, whose livelihoods depend on effective land management and allocation. While land is often cultivated by the various members of a farm household, land allocation decisions depend on the approval, the ambition and the abilities of influential household members, likely affecting all other household members, too. While intra-household decision-making processes have been described to depend on the interplay of prevailing interests and power positions, so far knowledge on interests and power positions is based on individual reports rather than actual observations. With the aim to explore the process of land allocation in a socially complex smallholder farm system, we invited members of a smallholder community in Northern Ghana to join a closed, experimental serious game, simulating a negotiation process between a male household head (HHH), a wife and the eldest son of a hypothetical local farm household. We observed an integrative negotiation style, resulting into high levels of satisfaction with the negotiation process and outcome by all parties, who reported a high level of similarity between simulated and real-life negotiations. Power was observed to be actively deployed, withheld or passively overruled depending on decision domains and process dynamics. While the HHH was the key decision maker acting as a strategic gatekeeper in a funnel-like process, the wife and the son had a significant influence on ‘his decision’ i.e. the household-level negotiation outcome. Model-based analysis also showed that the household-level outcome was more profitable as well as agro-biologically and nutritionally more diverse and productive as compared to the HHHs’ suggestion. The proposed game proved to be a culturally adequate, simple, cost and time effective tool to capture how household-level land use decisions may come about and whose interests they represent. Our study provides a powerful framework for further research and for policies to foster more equitable land use decisions and therewith more sustainable socio-ecological systems.

"Scaling agricultural mechanization services in smallholder farming systems: Case studies from sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America","There is great untapped potential for farm mechanization to support rural development initiatives in low- and middle-income countries. As technology transfer of large machinery from high-income countries was ineffective during the 1980s and 90s, mechanization options were developed appropriate to resource poor farmers cultivating small and scattered plots. More recently, projects that aim to increase the adoption of farm machinery have tended to target service providers rather than individual farmers. This paper uses the Scaling Scan tool to assess three project case studies designed to scale different Mechanization Service Provider Models (MSPMs) in Mexico, Zimbabwe, and Bangladesh. It provides a useful framework to assess the gap between international lessons learned on scaling captured in forty tactical questions over ten “scaling ingredients” as perceived by stakeholders involved in the projects, as well as private sector actors and government employees. Although at first sight the case studies seem to successfully reach high numbers of end users, the assessment exposes issues around the sustainable and transformative nature of the interventions. These are highly influenced by the design of the projects and by the environment and context of the intervention areas. Across the three case studies, large-scale adoption of the models was found to be hampered by lack of finance to set up MSPMs and insufficient collaboration among the value chain actors to strengthen and foster Mechanization Service Provider (MSP) entrepreneurs. Applying a scaling perspective on each case study project exposed important lessons on minimizing project dependencies. Positive examples include integration of capacity development materials in vocational training centers in Zimbabwe, promotion of MSPMs by other donors in East Africa and levering of nearly USD six million of private sector investment in appropriate machinery in Bangladesh. On the other hand, there is still a high dependency on the projects in terms of coaching of service providers, facilitating collaboration along the value chain, and provision of leadership and advocacy to address issues at governance level. These results have important implications for similar development interventions aimed at increasing smallholder access to mechanization services at scale and is to our knowledge the first cross-continental assessment of these issues to date.",Elsevier,"Van Loon, J., Woltering, L., Krupnik, T.J., Baudron, F., Boa, M., Govaerts, B.",0,"Explore more-https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X18314914",,,Other,Other,,"Empirical study",Mexico|Zimbabwe|Bangladesh,"Innovations within the supply chain: Value chain infrastructure","SDG 1 - No Poverty",Crops,"Primary production: crops","Journal article",1,"2023-03-05 23:29:27",theAdmin,2020-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2301,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2301,no,MEX|ZWE|BGD

Agricultural commercialization refers to the increase in agricultural output sold on the market instead of being consumed at home. The study found that there is a continuous distribution of farmers from those who do not sell any of their crop production to those who sell all their production, and virtually all rural households purchase food to supplement their own production. The study also found that agricultural commercialization has increased between 2012 and 2019, with the marketed share of crop production increasing by 6 to 10 percentage points. However, female-headed households, poor households, and those in low-rainfall areas are being left behind in this trend.

"Quiet Revolution by SMEs in the midstream of value chains in developing regions: wholesale markets, wholesalers, logistics, and processing","Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the midstream (processors, wholesalers and wholesale markets, and logistics) segments of transforming value chains have proliferated rapidly over the past several decades in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Their spread has been most rapid in the long transitional stage between the traditional and modern stages, when value chains grow long and developed with urbanization but are still fragmented, before consolidation. Most of Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, and parts of the other regions, are in that stage. The midstream SMEs in output and input value chains are important to overall food security (moving about 65% of food consumed in Africa and South Asia), and to employment, farmers, poor consumers, and the environment. The midstream of value chains is neglected in the national and international debates as the “missing middle.” We found that it is indeed not missing but rather hidden from the debate, hence “the hidden middle.” The midstream SMEs grow quickly and succeed where enabling conditions are present. Our main policy recommendations are to support the SMEs further growth through a focus on infrastructure investment, in particular on wholesale markets and roads, a reduction of policy-related constraints such as excessive red tape, and regulation for food safety and good commercial practices.",Springer,"Reardon, T., O.

"How resilience innovations in food supply chains are revolutionizing logistics, wholesale trade, and farm services in developing countries","Developing country food supply chains have been pummeled by a series (and often a confluence) of shocks over the past several decades, including the Russia-Ukraine war, COVID-19, climate shocks from hurricanes to floods to droughts, animal and plant diseases, an intensification of road banditry and local conflicts, and overlaying all these, deep transformation in markets themselves with new requirements for quality and food safety. Yet supply chains have been largely resilient, adapting and bouncing back in surprising ways. We show that this has often involves deep ‘pivoting’ by one segment or one value chain, and ‘co-pivoting’ by another to facilitate the former’s pivot. We present a conceptual framework and then illustrate with a variety of examples from Africa and Asia, such as pivoting toward e-commerce by Asian retailers and co-pivoting by delivery intermediaries; pivoting toward quality horticultural production by African and Asian farmers and co-pivoting by mobile outsource services for farming and marketing; and building of redundant ports to protect rice milling operations from climate shocks in Asia by agribusiness and logistic firms. The paper provides implications for policy to facilitate these adaptions and for resilience strategies of agribusiness firms.","Wageningen Academic Publishers","Reardon T., Vos R.",0,"Explore the full paper-https://www.wageningenacademic.com/doi/ref/10.22434/IFAMR2022.0138?role=tab",,,Other,"Poverty reduction and livelihoods","Grains: rice","Synthesis paper","Thailand|South Africa|China|Brazil","Innovations within the supply chain","SDG 1 - No Poverty",Crops,"Pre-harvest|Post-harvest: logistics|Post-harvest: wholesale trade","Journal article",1,"2023-02-15 16:06:15",theAdmin,2023-02-15T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2330,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2330,no,THA|ZAF|CHN|BRA
"Rural Employment in Africa: Trends and Challenges","Africa's rural population continues to expand rapidly, and labor productivity in agriculture and many rural-off farm activities remains low. This review uses the lens of a dual economy and the associated patterns of agricultural, rural, and structural transformation to review the evolution of Africa's rural employment and its inclusiveness. Many African countries still find themselves in an early stage of the agricultural and rural transformation. Given smaller sectoral productivity gaps than commonly assumed, greater size effects, and larger spillovers, investment in agriculture and the rural off-farm economy remains warranted to broker the transition to more and more productive rural employment. The key policy questions thus become how best to invest in the agri-food system (on and increasingly also off the farm) and how best to generate demand for nonagricultural goods and services that rural households can competitively produce. Informing these choices continues to present a major research agenda, with digital technologies, the imperative of greening, and intra-African liberalization raising many unarticulated and undocumented opportunities and challenges.","World Bank","Christiaensen, L., Maertens, M.",0,"Explore the full paper-https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/423521645602857176/pdf/Rural-Employment-in-Africa-Trends-and-Challenges.pdf",,,Other,"Income and employment opportunities: employment",,"Synthesis paper","Africa: Eastern Africa|Africa: Middle Africa|Africa: Northern Africa|Africa: Southern Africa|Africa: Sub-Saharan Africa|Africa: Western Africa",,"SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth",,,"Research report",1,"2023-02-13 15:02:43",theAdmin,2022-10-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2191,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2191,no,|||||
"Global and country Agri-Food Market and Policy Analysis Models (AMPAM)","To fill the data and policy modeling void, in collaboration with the Foresight and Metrics Initiative, an integrated system of global and country Agri-Food Market and Policy Analysis Models (AMPAM) is developed to assess potential for and trade-offs associated with the scaling of interventions and innovations that create jobs, boost incomes, and reduce environmental footprints along food value chains.
The databases of AMPAM and the scenario analyses conducted with AMPAM will be made accessible through KISM. The database will be compiled based on currently disjointed and fragmented data sources and reconciled using a comprehensive and systematic socio-economic and environmental accounting framework for the agri-food system. Using this methodology, it will be able to measure the economic and social importance of food markets and assess environmental impacts from farm to fork, substantially expanding and integrating existing CGIAR work in this area, including IFPRI’s AGGDP+ and AGEMP+ project and IFPRI’s greenhouse gas emissions database and measures of policy support to agriculture and food sectors by main food commodities of the AgIncentives consortium (FAO-IFPRI-IDB-OECD-World Bank). Detailed by food commodities and value chains and across countries, the AMPAM database will allow researchers to calculate indicators on the shares of different segments of the food system in value added, total food consumption, international trade, employment by types of worker, wage and other factor incomes, GHG emissions, and other environmental footprints. These indicators can help decision-makers identify inequalities, the potential for employment and income generation, and sources of environmental pressures across the food system.
The AMPAM model system will integrate three types of modleing frameworks that can support decision-makers in assessing the full potential, scalability, market opportunities, priorities for and trade-offs associated with incentive schemes, and investments and innovations.
Concretely, this initiative will develop and integrate the following tools: (a) food market potential and demand analysis; (b) value chain and policy and investment needs analysis; and (c) economy-wide and food-systemwide investment priority and impact analysis of interventions for inclusive and sustainable food systems, improving the existing economy-wide modeling frameworks for global and country-level food market and value chain analysis, MIRAGRODEP and RIAPA.
The initiative will also provide scenario analysis at the global and country level of options for repurposing existing agricultural support in ways conducive for scaling food-sytemwide interventions and innovations and optimizing benefits in terms of inclusion and sustainability. This scenario analysis will leverage and enhance analyses undertaken by IFPRI and partners using the MIRAGRODEP global modeling framework.",CGIAR,"Martin, W.",0,,,,"Knowledge tools for policy coherence and market reform",Other,,,Global,,"SDG 1 - No Poverty",,,Database,1,"2023-02-13 14:03:26",theAdmin,2023-02-13T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2190,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2190,yes,
"Value addition and farmers: Evidence from coffee in Ethiopia","Local value-addition in developing countries is often aimed at for upgrading of agricultural
value chains, since it is assumed that doing so will make farmers better off. However, transmission
of the added value through the value chain and constraints to adoption of value-adding
activities by farmers are not well understood. We look at this issue in the case of coffee
in Ethiopia–the country’s most important export product–and value-addition in the coffee
value-chain through ‘washing’ coffee, which is done in wet mills. Washed coffee is sold internationally
with a significant premium compared to ‘natural’ coffee but the share of washed
coffee in Ethiopia’s coffee exports has stagnated. Relying on a unique primary large-scale
dataset and a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, we examine the reasons
for this puzzle. The reasons seemingly are twofold. First, labor productivity in producing red
cherries, which wet mills require, is lower than for natural coffee, reducing incentives for
adoption, especially for those farmers with higher opportunity costs of labor. Second, only
impatient, often smaller, farmers sell red cherries, as more patient farmers use the storable
dried coffee cherries as a rewarding savings instrument, given the negative real deposit
rates in formal savings institutions.",PLOS,"Tamru, S., Minten, B.",0,"Explore the full paper-https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0273121",,,"Rethinking food markets initiative","Poverty reduction and livelihoods","Industrial crops: coffee","Empirical study",Ethiopia,"Innovations within the supply chain","SDG 10 - Reduce Inequalities",Crops,Post-harvest,"Journal article",1,"2023-02-03 14:16:11",theAdmin,2023-01-30T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2180,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2180,yes,ETH
"Market Links between Actors of the Honduras Coffee Supply Chains","Coffee is one of the major crops produced in Honduras. This country is the world’s sixth largest producer and the largest producer in Central America. Its contribution to the economy cannot be overstated: it accounts for 5% of the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 26% of the agricultural GDP. The Honduran coffee sector has made significant progress towards its modernization and, as a result, has increased both its aggregate production and farm productivity. Yet, these positive metrics contrast with increasing concerns about the environmental and social sustainability of the sector. 
It is in this context that the initiative Rethinking Markets and Value Chains for Inclusion and Sustainability conducts this scoping study. Its goal is to review the agricultural policy context and describe the coffee global value chain (GVC), identifying key constraints to reducing the costs of production and marketing and making the chain more inclusive. The information that feeds this study is the result of a systemic review of the literature and the analysis of secondary data on the coffee supply chain in Honduras.",CGIAR,"Ceballos-Sierra, F.",1,"Explore the full paper-https://cgspace.cgiar.org/bitstream/handle/10568/128619/%236%20Initiative%20Note_Coffee_Final%20v.2.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y",,,"Making globally integrated value chains inclusive, efficient, and environmentally sustainable","Poverty reduction and livelihoods|Nutrition, health and food security: Food security/insecurity|Agribusiness profitability: output prices|Gender equality, youth and social inclusion|Agribusiness profitability: raw product quality","Industrial crops: coffee","Synthesis paper",Honduras,"Innovations within the supply chain","SDG 1 - No Poverty",Crops,"Primary production: crops","Research report",1,"2023-02-02 08:52:48",theAdmin,2022-12-30T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2177,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2177,yes,HND
"Digital Agriculture Platforms: Understanding Innovations in Rural Finance and Logistics in Uganda’s Agri-food Sector","Agriculture is the mainstay of Uganda’s economy, contributing about 25% of the GDP, a third of the ex- port earnings and almost all the country’s food requirements. Yet, the sector still faces various chal- lenges that affect production and the income derived from it. Systemic issues impact smallholder farmers' livelihoods across markets, land, skills, and capital, with cross-cutting social exclusion issues. Effective application of digital agricultural technologies has emerged as a catalyst in addressing productivity and efficiency challenges and enhancing inclusiveness in agri-food systems. Digital technologies have shown potential to address bottlenecks in access to extension services, marketing systems, suitable financial products, reliable weather information, transport services and logistics as well as supply chain management. Scaling of digital agricultural technologies in Uganda is critical for improving productivity and addressing challenges in the agricultural sector. However, for scaling to be undertaken effectively and inclusively, there is need to address the barriers that limit the use of digital innovations for some populations. However, the issues surrounding scaling and inclusivity of digital services are not well understood. This study therefore sought to contribute to bridging this knowledge gap through an assessment of the existing digitally enabled innovative cross-value chain services to gain insights into how the services are addressing inefficiencies, creating opportunities for improving efficiency and inclusiveness as well as identifying promising innovations for scaling. Specifically, the study focused on in- novations in finance and logistics for value chains. For finance, the study specifically looked at digital payments, credit, and insurance, while for logistics, the focus was on supply chain management, transportation, traceability, digital platforms for e-commerce, and (cold) storage across value chains.
The study used a qualitative approach to collect data in two phases: the first phase involved conducting an inception workshop followed with key informant interviews with 39 service providers and enablers. The second phase involved case studies using 12 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), 12 individual interviews and a validation workshop. The findings show potential for digital agricultural innovations to address some of the challenges. Several benefits are associated with the current use of digital innovations including linking value chain actors with the enabling services (e.g., insurance companies, banks, government), increased access to markets, access to extension and advisory services including market and weather information and quality agri-inputs and tractor services, services such as credit and savings, agri-insurance, agri-trucking, Heating Ventilation and Conditioning (HVAC) and warehousing. The use of digital innovations has for instance enabled access to agri-insurance and digital loans or credit which was not possible before. However, there are some challenges with the use of digital finance and logistic services. For instance, the study identified challenges of access due low awareness and information due to limited digital literacy, social norms and power relations that disadvantage some sections of the population such as the women and youth from access and some technology design issues that need to be addressed for effective and inclusive uptake and scaling. Additionally, the ICT infrastructure in Uganda is unevenly distributed with significant gaps between rural and urban connectivity. Communication infrastructure (e.g., network coverage and broadband services) is established in urban centers, but rural areas have poor or no connectivity. Limited access to electricity is a major cause of the discrepancies in urban–rural Internet use and mobile phone penetration rates in Uganda. Yet mobile technology is at the heart of the digital transformation in Uganda as in most parts of sub-Saharan Africa.
The study also identified some promising innovations that offer opportunities for scaling, following prioritization by stakeholders of the most significant challenges to scaling (low awareness of services and lack of information to support farmers to make a case for investing in digital services). These innovations have active SMEs and start-ups engaged in them and include digital input supplies and payments bundled with agronomic advisories, e-market places for outputs bundled with digital payments services and logistics, and agricultural logistics services involving transport and warehousing services.",CGIAR,"Ajambo, S., Ogutu, S., Birachi, E., Kikulwe, E",0,,,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/sites/default/files/2023-02/Initiative%20Note_WP3_Uganda_final.pdf,"Rethinking food markets initiative","Gender equality, youth and social inclusion",,"Empirical study",Uganda,"Innovations within the supply chain: Vertical integration|Innovations within the supply chain: Financial services|Innovations within the supply chain: Logistics services","SDG 10 - Reduce Inequalities",,,"Research report",1,"2023-02-02 08:32:00",theAdmin,2022-12-26T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2176,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2176,yes,UGA
"The political economy of reforming agricultural support policies","Agricultural support policies cost more than US$800 billion per year in transfers to the farm sector worldwide. Support policies based on subsidies and trade barriers are highly distortive to markets and are also regressive as most support is provided to larger farmers. On balance, the incentives this support creates appear to increase greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. In addition, some subsidies undermine the production of more nutrient-dense commodities that are otherwise critical for the improvement of dietary outcomes. This paper first highlights that better outcomes could be achieved if even a small portion of agricultural subsidies were repurposed into investments in research and development (R&D) dedicated to productivity-enhancing and emission-reducing technologies. This would create multiple wins — mitigating global climate change, reducing poverty, increasing food security, and improving nutrition. Nonetheless, the political economy challenges to doing so are sizeable. Because current support policies are often politically popular and serve well-organized interests, reform is difficult without committed political leadership and multilateral collaboration. Using several case studies of both successful and failed changes of agricultural support policies in China, India, and the EU and the United States, we highlight lessons learned about the political economy constraints on and possibilities for reform.",CGIAR,"Vos, Rob, Martin, Will, Resnick, Danielle",0,"Explore the full paper-https://cgspace.cgiar.org/bitstream/handle/10568/127455/ifpridp02163.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y",,,Other,"Poverty reduction and livelihoods",,"Synthesis paper","China|India|United States of America","Innovations in the enabling environment: Support and trade policies|Innovations in the enabling environment: Sustainable development policies","SDG 1 - No Poverty",Services,"Primary production","Research report",1,"2023-01-31 16:05:40",theAdmin,2022-12-26T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2175,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2175,no,CHN|IND|USA

"Landscape report on existing financial and logistic services in the agricultural sector in Bangladesh","The economy of Bangladesh is largely defined by the agricultural sector, which is reflected in its yearly GDP contribution of approximately 11% in the past few years (World Bank, 2022). The sector holds the potential for even higher contributions to the economy, provided effective initiatives related to financial inclusion, and logistical innovations are implemented. Even during the immense global challenges during to the Covid-19 pandemic, the country’s agricultural sector persisted. Improving traditional initiatives and practices to address constraints faced by farmers and other agricultural value chain actors will enable the sector to expand and benefit new sections of the population, including those most vulnerable such as the poor, women, and youth. Many of the recent innovations in the agricultural sector in Bangladesh have been initiated by ‘AgriTech’ companies/start-ups in the space of financial and logistical services. Financial services are available for both small and large-scale agriculture operations in the country. Besides innovations in financial services, there has been a burgeoning list of logistical services as well. Utilizing this wave of innovations appropriately can help the agricultural sector reach its full potential for success. This report is arranged in the following manner. First, section 1 discusses the traditional services in the financial and logistic sectors, and then section 2 discusses the existing constraints in both sectors.

"Country Scoping Report - Nigeria: Innovations and policy design for development for cross-value chain services (logistics and financial services)","Work Package 3 (Innovations and policy design for development for cross-value chain services to leverage new employment and income opportunities) under the CGIAR initiative on Rethinking Food Markets intends to address the question: How can cross-food value chain and market services function better to increase employment and boost income of smallholders and SMEs? The WP focuses on two types of cross-value chain services, logistics and financial services. (1) logistics services – supply chain management, transportation, traceability, digital platforms for e-com merce, and (cold) storage. (2) value-chain financial services – mainly focusing on digital financial services (DFS) that facilitate trans actions, savings, access to and use of credit, and insurance. The logistics services in agri-food systems in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are often targeted at large-scale enterprises with greater market power and less accessible to smallholder farmers and small and micro enterprises (SMEs). WP3 aims to assess the ways in which these emerging logistics services (including digital platforms) can be cost-effectively targeted at smallholder farmers and agri-food SMEs. Regarding DFS, the WP will investigate cost-effective ways of improving access to and adoption of DFS among smallholders and agri-food SMEs, especially among women and youth. Though these emerging DFS appear to have a high potential to benefit smallholders and SMEs across the agri-food value chains in LMICs, they need a reliable internet connection, a suitable mobile phone network, and a broad network of mobile money agents to be effective. WP3 thus aims to identify innovations/emerging logistics and DFS and test their effectiveness to smallholders and SMEs using randomized control trials (RCTs) in pilots, with the goal of country-specific scalable designs.",CGIAR,"Balana, Bedru B., Olanrewaju, Opeyemi S., Ambler, Kate, Brauw, Alan de, Bloem, Jeffrey, Kadjo, Didier, Wossen, Tesfamicheal, Liverpool-Tassie, Saweda Onipede, Abdoulaye, Tahirou",0,,,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/sites/default/files/2023-02/Initiative%20Note_WP3_Nigeria_final.pdf,"Innovations and policy design for development for cross value chain services","Household income",,"Empirical study",Nigeria,"Innovations within the supply chain: Financial services|Innovations within the supply chain: Logistics services","SDG 1 - No Poverty",Services,Finance,"Research report",1,"2023-01-31 11:40:36",theAdmin,2022-12-30T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2169,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2169,yes,NGA
"Scoping Study on Ethiopian Sesame Value Chain","The characteristics of global value chains create some important opportunities to improve the livelihoods of producers, processors, and traders. Global value chains often cater to quality-sensitive consumers in other countries, creating an opportunity for farmers and other value-chain participants to benefit from improving quality, being more inclusive, and/or demonstrating sustainable production methods. Because global value chains are long, communication between consumers and producers is difficult. However, information and communication technology can help bridge this gap and facilitate coordination of supply and demand. Innovations that increase the output and quality of export commodities in a given country are unlikely to reduce the global price, so farmers and small enterprises involved in trading and processing are more likely to benefit than if the commodity were only marketed domestically. At the same time, these chains present significant challenges. It is necessary to understand the product characteristics that affect consumer demand in destination countries, including quality, color, size, and even production methods, such as the environmental impact. Information on these requirements need to be communicated to farmers and local processors, along with a system for offering a premium for the higher quality. Coordinating harvest & transport of export agricultural products can be difficult, particularly for perishable commodities that may need to arrive within 24 hours of harvest. A major challenge is minimizing the cost and delays in domestic and international transport, including phyto-sanitary inspection. Another challenge is ensuring the benefits of global value chains are shared among disadvantaged 4 groups, including small farmers and women. Because of quality requirements and the advantages of scale, larger and better-connected producers are often at an advantage in producing export commodities. Global value chains are more affected by trade and exchange rate policies than domestic value chains. For example, export commodities are vulnerable to unexpected changes in export taxes and over-valuation of the exchange rate, which reduce the return on exports. WP1 will study the impact of promising interventions that improve the livelihoods of farmers and other participants in targeted global value chains. This work package is being implemented in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Honduras, and Uzbekistan. The case study in Ethiopia focuses on oilseeds value chains. Oilseeds play an important role in the Ethiopian economy and empirical evidence have shown that there is so much potential in oilseeds that Ethiopia can exploit. A study that considered all value chains to be equally important for the economy prioritized oilseeds, fruits/tree crops, vegetables, tobacco/cotton/tea and cattle value chains in Ethiopia (Benfica & Thurlow, 2017). The most important oilseeds in Ethiopia are sesame, soybeans, and groundnuts. Sesame is the largest exported oilseed: in 2019, sesame exports from Ethiopia were worth US$ 307 million, making it the second-largest agricultural export after coffee. Sesame is primarily an export crop. In contrast, groundnut and soybean are marketed domestically and internationally, and exports are considerably smaller (US$ 85 million combined). About 75% of Ethiopian sesame production takes place in the regions of Amhara (particularly in Gonder) and western Tigray. Smaller amounts are grown in Oromia, Benshangul-Gumuz, SNNP, and Gambella. A large majority of sesame is grown on small-scale family farms, although larger commercial farms account for about 18% of production. Almost all sesame is exported in the form of raw seed and converted to sesame oil, tahini, and other products in the destination countries. This is presumably because sesame oil is relatively expensive and not widely used in Ethiopian cooking. Most vegetable oil for domestic consumption is imported, and 90% of the imported quantity is palm oil. There are several hundred vegetable oil processing plants in Ethiopia. The most common types of oil produced domestically are niger seed oil (72% of processing plants), linseed oil, and groundnut oil (GAIN, 2018). Although some Ethiopian sesame has a reputation for high quality on international markets, the sesame value chain is characterized by low productivity, fragmentation, high transaction cost, and limited information. The Ethiopian Commodity Exchange (ECX) has a grading system for sesame, but traders often grade sesame only after it has been aggregated from multiple farmers, making it difficult to provide a premium to individual farmers. Farmers complain that the informal grading and price determination is not 5 transparent. In addition, the ECX has established various channels for delivering market information to farmers, but access to the information remains a problem. These constraints are undermining the performance of the value chain across all nodes of production and marketing. Addressing the key researchable constraints through bundles of innovations is what the markets initiative is planning to do in Ethiopia. The Initiative is starting its interventions in Ethiopia with a scoping study of the sesame value chain. This report summarizes the findings of the scoping study on the oilseeds value chain in Ethiopia. The overall objective of the scoping study is to identify a limited number of interventions that will be subsequently tested through some form of impact evaluation. In order to achieve this overall objective, the scoping study has three intermediate goals: i To describe the structure and operation of the supply chain, from input markets to primary production, processing, and export of the commodity. ii To diagnose problems in the supply chain, defined as obstacles or constraints which reduce the earnings of participants, limit participation of women and other disadvantaged groups, and/or exacerbate the environmental impact. iii To explore the merits of alternative solutions that may address one or more of these problems, where the evaluation is based on an analysis of secondary data, the views of stakeholders, pilot projects, and experience in other countries. The data and information for the scoping study were generated from literature, secondary data, and stakeholder workshops.",CGIAR,"Kassie, Girma T., Worku, Yonas, Bachewe, Fantu Nisrane, Asnake, Woinishet, Abate, Gashaw Tadesse",0,,,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/sites/default/files/2023-02/Initiative%20Note_Sesame.pdf,"Making globally integrated value chains inclusive, efficient, and environmentally sustainable","Agribusiness profitability: market access|Agribusiness profitability: output prices","Oilseeds & vegetable oils: sesame","Synthesis paper",Ethiopia,"Innovations within the supply chain: Market information accessibility|Innovations within the supply chain: Value chain infrastructure","SDG 1 - No Poverty",Crops,Post-harvest|Pre-harvest,"Research report",1,"2023-01-31 11:22:05",theAdmin,2022-12-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2168,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2168,yes,ETH
"Scale and sustainability: The impact of a women’s self-help group program on household economic well-being in India","Microfinance groups are a prominent source of small-scale rural credit in many developing countries. In India, evidence of the impact of the now ubiquitous women-only savings and credit self-help groups (SHGs) on household consumption and asset accumulation is inconclusive and based on small-scale interventions. Further, little is known about the sustainability of impacts at scale. We use panel data on close to 2500 households from five states in India to estimate the impact of SHG membership on household expenditure and asset ownership. Over four years, we find small but significant impacts of SHG membership on household expenditure and livestock ownership. Membership duration has a modest effect, suggesting that initial impacts may taper off as the program scales up, though small sample sizes limit our ability to draw inferences. Accompanying evidence on pathways is compelling; related work shows that SHG participation improves information, empowerment, and access to entitlements. While the direct impacts of SHG membership may not suffice to fill gaps in access to credit faced by the rural poor, impacts along these additional pathways could intensify the benefits of these groups","Taylor and Francis Online","Raghunathan, Kalyani, Kumar, Neha, Gupta, Shivani, Thai, Giang, Scott, Samuel, Choudhury, Avijit, Khetan, Madhu, Menon, Purnima, Quisumbing, Agnes R.",0,"READ THE FULL PAPER-https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00220388.2022.2154151",,,"Rethinking food markets initiative","Gender equality, youth and social inclusion",Grains,"Empirical study",India,"Innovations in the enabling environment","SDG 5 - Gender Equality",Crops,Finance,"Journal article",1,"2023-01-12 10:16:01",soonho.kim,2022-12-14T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2144,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2144,yes,IND
"Financial services and logistics innovation within agri-food value chains: A conceptual framework","Finance and logistics services for agricultural value chains based on technological innovations exist in several LMICs, but they are not often extended to small holders or SMEs working in the agricultural midstream. We consider the constraints to adoption of those services faced by smallholders or SMEs.

"Agri-food value chain revolutions in low- and middle-income countries","Agri-food value chains (AVCs) intermediate the flow of products between largely rural farmers, fisherfolk, or herders and increasingly urban consumers. The theoretical models that historically structured research on the economic development process assumed away AVC functions, however, and AVC firms and workers were necessarily omitted from the household data that generated most empirical findings in the agricultural and development economics literatures. As a result, the discipline has somewhat overlooked the rapid growth and structural change in AVCs over the past few decades that turned AVCs into major employers and sources of value addition, as well as key loci for technology transfer and foreign investment. This paper offers an integrated, structured, empirical narrative of how and why AVC revolutions occur in developing countries, the impacts of those changes, and the abundant economic research opportunities these structural changes afford economists.","Journal of Economic Literature","Barrett, Christopher B., Reardon, Thomas, Swinnen, Johan, Zilberman, David",0,"READ THE FULL PAPER-https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20201539",,,"Rethinking food markets initiative","Poverty reduction and livelihoods",Grains,"Synthesis paper",Global,"Innovations in the enabling environment","SDG 1 - No Poverty",Crops,"Primary production","Journal article",1,"2023-01-12 09:51:06",soonho.kim,2022-12-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2142,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2142,yes,
"Rural income diversification in Ethiopia: Patterns, trends, and welfare impacts","Increased diversification of rural households into the rural non-farm economy is an important driver of economic growth and structural transformation in countries like Ethiopia where the vast majority of people live in rural areas and are largely dependent on seasonal agriculture. Some of the benefits of diversification include efficient utilization of asset endowments (e.g., labor during dry season) and reduction of risks. In this study we explore the: (i) patterns and trends of diversification, (ii) drivers of diversification including the association between rainfall risk/shocks and diversification, and (iii) welfare effects of diversification during the recent decade using three rounds of representative household data from the four main regions of Ethiopia. We used Cragg’s double-hurdle model, a method that considers the two-step decision making process in diversification (i.e., participation and extent of participation), to identify the determinants of diversification and a fixed-effect and instrumental variable (IV) approaches to understand the links between diversification and household welfare. The descriptive results show that rural households generally adopt a livelihood strategy dominated by farming and that the level of diversification has been stagnant over the period of analysis considered. More importantly, the vast majority of households continue to draw a substantial share of their income from crop production, followed by livestock. The income from non-farm activities accounts only between 17 percent and 23 percent of the total income. The econometrics results show that diversification is positively associated with credit access, membership in social insurance, ownership of mobile phone, relative measure of household wealth, and population density. Conversely, access to relatively large, fertile, and irrigable land discourages diversification into non-farm activities. The analysis on the association between rainfall risks and diversification indicates that rural households use income diversification both as risk mitigation and shock coping strategy. The results on the link between income diversification and household welfare indicate a positive association between diversification and household total consumption expenditure, dietary diversity score, and housing/roof quality. In sum, the results imply the need for a deliberate effort to expand the non-farm economy so as to tap its full potential for employment generation, income growth, and welfare improvements. A starting point could be for agricultural and rural development policies and investments to go beyond promotion of cereal crop production and facilitate participation in high value crop, livestock, aquaculture production. Incentivizing investments in value addition activities that can create and enrich upward and downward linkages in the midstream segment of agricultural value chains is another potential avenue to boost rural non-farm economy.

"ValueLinks 2.0","ValueLinks is the name given to a systematic compilation of action-oriented methods for promoting economic development with a value chain perspective. It provides essential know-how on ways to enhance employment and the business income of micro and small-sized enterprises and farmers by promoting the value chains they are operating in. The ValueLinks manual is intended for use by development projects or by public agencies promoting specific agribusiness, handicraft or manufacturing sub-sectors of the economy. It has no specific sectoral focus. However, the emphasis is on those product markets that offer opportunities for the poor. The ValueLinks manual is one of several knowledge products that use the ValueLinks methodology. 
ValueLinks is entirely action-oriented. The know-how has been compiled by reviewing reallife experience. It builds on lessons learned with rural development programmes and private sector promotion supported by GTZ. The ValueLinks manual structures the know-how of value chain promotion into 12 modules organised according to the project cycle. It starts with the decision whether to engage in value chain promotion at all, and how to combine VC promotion with other development approaches (module 0). The first step in value chain promotion is the identification of a value chain to promote (module 1), followed by value chain analysis (module 2) and the formulation of a chain upgrading strategy (module 3). Module 4 presents know-how for facilitators of value chain promotion projects. The following modules (5-10) are all devoted to the implementation of projects. Three major fields of action are distinguished – business linkages (modules 5-6), services (modules 7-8) 1 and the business environment including standards (modules 9-10). Finally, module 11 closes the cycle with know-how on monitoring impacts and managing for development results. The core of the ValueLinks methodology is contained in modules 1-4 and 11, which consist of know-how that is specific to the value chain concept. Modules 5-10, on the other hand, utilise and adapt knowledge from other related fields of development work. 
ValueLinks does not prescribe any particular sequence in which the modules should be used. In fact, the methodology is iterative. Practitioners usually have to move between implementation and analysis. Monitoring is placed at the end in the above graph, but should certainly be conducted throughout the process. Each module specifies recurring tasks that business organisations and facilitators of value chain promotion have to perform. Users can choose among a total of 37 tasks, e.g. “value chain mapping”, “agreeing on a vision” or “engaging private partners in development work”. Text boxes present tools and templates as well as concrete examples of value chain projects supported by GTZ around the world. This therefore provides users of the methodology with the building blocks with which they can construct their own VC promotion projects, selecting elements of ValueLinks according to their specific needs. ","German Technical Cooperation (GTZ)","Springer-Heinze, A.",0,"Explore the full paper-https://www.valuelinks.org/material/manual/",,,"Value Chains knowledge portal","Agribusiness profitability: market access","Honey|Grains: maize|Livestock","Empirical study","Mexico|Ethiopia|Afghanistan|Bangladesh|Viet Nam","Innovations within the supply chain","SDG 1 - No Poverty",Crops|Services,"Primary production|Post-harvest: wholesale trade|Consumption",Tool,1,"2023-01-10 16:13:40",theAdmin,2018-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2139,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2139,no,MEX|ETH|AFG|BGD|VNM
"Livestock and Fish Value Chain Assessment Toolkit (version 2)","Livestock and Fish value chains are unique and have distinct features. For instance, the products, such as milk and meat, are of higher value and in some cases are bulky and highly perishable. Also, delivery of some inputs and services such as animal health service is costly. In addition, at the livestock keepers’ level, livestock are predominantly multi-functional, often kept not only to produce milk or meat for home consumption and sale, but also to produce manure for fertilizing croplands, to pull ploughs and are also considered a major capital assets. For this reason, livestock keepers’ decisions in terms of type and level of participation in a value chain is influenced by many factors.
The uniqueness of the livestock and fish value chains compared to other value chains makes it paramount for researchers and development practitioners to use highly targeted tools, specialized and tailored to guide research and development interventions.
While all the value chain assessment tools developed and used in the course of the Livestock and Fish program implementation have been availed in an online working space, there was a need to document, organize and describe how to use these tools.
The toolkit will detail four main implementation stages to follow when carrying out analysis of livestock and fish value chains, moving from tools for broad characterization at national level to more detailed and focused tools. The tools in the last stage will include information on ‘best bet’ monitoring, evaluation and learning.

"Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index for market inclusion in the value chain (Pro-WEAI+MI)","This survey-based tool monitors and evaluates women's and men's empowerment across the value chain, based on 12 indicators, expanding on the pro-WEAI.
 
Why is the tool important?
Many development agencies design and implement socially-inclusive agricultural interventions for the various people along agricultural value chains.
Monitoring and evaluating the success of these interventions requires tools that can identify the constraints facing women and men, and track empowerment across multiple stages of the value chain.
This tool expands on the pro-WEAI index.
 
Who is the tool for?
The tool is intended for researchers, practitioners, and academics.
Countries of focus: Bangladesh, Benin, Malawi and the Philippines
 
How can I use the tool?
The Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) and abbreviated WEAI (A-WEAI) focuse more on the production dimension of agriculture.
However, the project-level WEAI for market inclusion (pro-WEAI+MI) takes the tool one step further to measure empowerment across the value chain.
The tool includes the core project-level WEAI (pro-WEAI) module plus new indicators to investigate barriers to market access and inclusion for different value chain actors.
It also offers several optional indicators to assess the empowerment environment, including access to reliable sanitation and sexual hostility in the working environment. These additions increase pro-WEAI’s ability to measure and contextualize empowerment and inclusion across value chains.
The new tool was piloted in Bangladesh, the Philippines, Benin, and Malawi.
 
When and how was it developed?
IFPRI developed this tool in 2020 as an extension to the existing pro-WEAI module.

"LINK methodology: a participatory guide to business models that link smallholders to markets","Major corporations and multi-national companies have long struggled with how to connect with and include small-scale suppliers. Connecting these two groups – smallholder farms and emerging markets – requires creative solutions to allow benefits for both sides. The LINK Methodology has started to close the gap between companies (See the outcome story about Unilever’s international buyer guide) and these two groups but has immense room to grow to continue to impact emerging markets.
The LINK Methodology was developed as part of the New Business Models for Sustainable Trading Relationships Project, managed by the Sustainable Food Lab in collaboration with Catholic Relief Services (CRS), the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) and Rainforest Alliance (RA) with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 
This tool is mainly aimed at facilitators who mediate the processes previously mentioned between sellers and buyers. LINK can help your organisation facilitate a systematic learning process between actors from a selected value chain, and discover new opportunities for innovation, based on the application of a participatory toolkit, with four main tools:
1. The value chain map (used to understand the macro context of markets and the businesses which link rural producers with buyers).
2. The business model canvas (used to understand in more detail each business which links rural producers with buyers).
3. The New Business Model principles (used to determine whether each business which links rural producers with buyers is truly inclusive).
4. The prototype cycle (used to continuously improve the inclusivity of every business which links rural producers with buyers).
By the end of the process you will have understood the relationship between specific business models (buyer and seller) and the overall value chain; identified critical areas for improvement; designed, implemented, evaluated and improved on the innovation prototype for the business model you selected; and evaluated the effects of these changes on smallholder farmers and on the business itself.","International Center for Tropical Agriculture","Lundy, Mark, Hurtado Bermudez, Jhon Jairo, Becx, Gertjan, Zamierowski, Nancy, Rodríguez, Fernando, Mosquera Echeverry, Erika Eliana",0,"Explore the full paper-https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/49606",,,"Value Chains knowledge portal","Agribusiness profitability: market access","Industrial crops: coffee|Fruits and vegetables|Industrial crops: cocoa","Empirical study",Colombia|Guatemala|Ecuador|Mexico|India|Peru,"Innovations within the supply chain: Inclusive business models","SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 5 - Gender Equality",Crops,"Post-harvest|Consumption|Primary production: crops",Tool,1,"2023-01-09 15:49:27",theAdmin,2014-11-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2136,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2136,no,COL|GTM|ECU|MEX|IND|PER
"Participatory market Chain Approach (PMCA) User Guide","The Participatory Market Chain Approach (PMCA) is a flexible R&D approach that engages small farmers, market agents, researchers, and other service providers in a facilitated collective action that aims at identifying and exploiting potential business opportunities that benefit small-scale producers and other chain actors. The approach was developed by the International Potato Center (CIP) and first applied in the Andes before spreading to SSA, Asia and other parts of the world.  
The PMCA offers a practical way to conduct R&D that supports pro-poor innovation in agricultural market chains. The approach brings the key stakeholders in an innovation process – including farmers, market agents, researchers, and other service providers – together to jointly identify, assess and exploit new business opportunities. Through this interaction, the PMCA triggers innovation processes. Experience indicates that the PMCA is most effective when implemented as part of a multi-pronged gender responsive initiative that includes support for farmer organizations, business development, policy change, and public awareness. When the PMCA is applied with appropriate complementary measures, it can assist smallholders improve their participation in dynamic markets and improve their livelihoods.","International Potato Center","Bernet, T, Thiele G., Zschocke, T.",0,"Explore the full paper-http://cipotato.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/003296.pdf",,,"Value Chains knowledge portal","Agribusiness profitability: market access|Gender equality, youth and social inclusion","Fruits and vegetables|Industrial crops: coffee","Empirical study","Peru|Albania|Bangladesh|Bolivia (Plurinational State of)|Indonesia|Nepal|Uganda","Innovations within the supply chain: Value chain infrastructure","SDG 1 - No Poverty",Crops,"Primary production: crops",Tool,1,"2023-01-09 13:55:09",theAdmin,2006-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2135,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2135,no,PER|ALB|BGD||IDN|NPL|UGA
"5 capitals: a tool for assessing the poverty impacts of value chain development","This tool seeks to help you address common shortcomings in value chain development (VCD) assessment by (1) Applying an asset-based approach; (2) Using impact pathways; (3) Harnessing the insights from multiscale and multidimensional analysis; (4) Promoting organizational learning. The tool has been tested in 20+ countries in South Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC).
 
What is it good for?
5Capitals facilitates learning about the potential of value chain development (VCD) to strengthen rural livelihoods and improve business performance. Learning is derived from measuring and observing changes in various assets managed by smallholder households and the enterprises with which they have direct contact. These smallholder-linked enterprises play a critical role in linking smallholders to markets. Underpinning 5Capitals is the belief that the greater a household’s access to livelihood assets, such as human, social, natural, physical and financial capitals, the higher its well-being and resilience. Likewise, the greater a linked enterprise’s access to business assets, including human, social, physical and financial capitals, the greater its economic viability and performance. The tool helps users understand critical development issues, such as the extent to which preexisting asset endowments determine the outcomes of VCD, the relationship between asset building at the enterprise and household levels, and the role of market, political and institutional factors in facilitating or hindering favorable outcomes. The methodological framework underlying 5Capitals helps users separate the changes caused by interactions and interventions in value chains from those induced by the overall context.
Who is it for?
5Capitals aims to support the following types of organizations involved in VCD:

Funding agencies looking for more effective and efficient programs to reduce rural poverty through VCD
NGOs, consultants, government agencies and other organizations providing services to smallholders and businesses that want to deliver more impactful VCD interventions
Businesses engaged with smallholders that want to determine their contribution to poverty reduction and improve their social and environmental credentials
Certification bodies that seek to understand the contribution of voluntary standard systems to building more resilient smallholder production and livelihood systems

What are its salient features?
5Capitals stimulates learning among stakeholders and facilitates continuous improvement toward higher-impact interactions and interventions in value chains through the following:

An asset-based approach that considers changes in livelihood and business assets resulting from VCD, which in turn provide important insights into advances in poverty reduction and improved business performance
Impact pathways that provide a practical framework for selecting indicators and developing a theory of change related to asset building by smallholders and their enterprises
Multiscale and multidimensional analysis that considers the effects of multiple-source interventions on asset building at household and enterprise levels
Field-tested and validated methodological framework that incorporates lessons learned from 23 case studies from Africa, Asia, Latin America and North America
Focus on organizational learning that involves VCD stakeholders throughout the process and uses the findings to redesign VCD initiatives and reallocate resources accordingly

"Have food supply chain policies improved forest conservation and rural livelihoods? A systematic review","To address concerns about the negative impacts of food supply chains in forest regions, a growing number of companies have adopted policies to influence their suppliers' behaviors. With a focus on forest-risk food supply chains, we provide a systematic review of the conservation and livelihood outcomes of the mechanisms that companies use to implement their forest-focused supply chain policies (FSPs) - certifications, codes of conduct, and market exclusion mechanisms. More than half of the 37 cases that rigorously measure the outcomes of FSP implementation mechanisms find additional conservation and livelihood benefits resulting from the policies. Positive livelihood outcomes are more common than conservation additionality and most often pertain to improvements in farm income through increases in crop yields on coffee and cocoa farms that have adopted certifications or codes of conduct. However, in some cases certifications lead to a reduction in net household income as farmers increasingly specialize in the certified commodity and spend more on food purchases. Among the five cases that examine conservation and livelihoods simultaneously, there is no evidence of tradeoffs or synergies â€“ most often an improvement in one type of outcome is associated with no change in the other. Interactions with public conservation and agricultural policies influence the conservation gains achieved by all mechanisms, while the marketing attributes of cooperatives and buying companies play a large role in determining the livelihood outcomes associated with certification. Compliance with the forest requirements of FSP implementation mechanisms is high, but challenges to geospatial monitoring and land use related selection biases limit the overall benefits of these policies. Given the highly variable methods and limited evidence base, additional rigorous research across a greater variety of contexts is urgently needed to better understand if and when FSPs can be successful in achieving synergies between conservation and livelihoods.","IOP Science","Garrett, R. , Levy, S. ,  Gollnow, F.,  Hodel, L, Rueda, X.",0,"Full report-https://www.evidensia.eco/resources/1120/have-food-supply-chain-policies-improved-forest-conservation-and-rural-livelihoods-a-systematic-review/",,,"Evidensia platform","Climate change adaptation: restoration and afforestation|Climate mitigation: reforestation|Household income: labour income|Household income: farm income|Household income: livestock income|Climate adaptation and mitigation|Poverty reduction and livelihoods",,"Synthesis paper",Global,"Product or farm level: Product certification|Innovations within the supply chain: Procurement","SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 12 - Responsible Production and Consumption|SDG 15 - Life on Land",,"Primary production: crops|Primary production: livestock","Journal article",1,"2022-12-05 08:59:40",soonho.kim,2021-02-22T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2085,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2085,no,
"Solar Power to Transform Food Systems and Rural Livelihoods: Evidence from a Solar-Powered Cold Storage Intervention in Nigeria","In developing countries, a substantial amount of perishable and often highly nutritious commodities, such as fruits and vegetables, are lost after harvest, mainly caused by the lack of key infrastructures, such as electricity and cold chain facilities. On the other hand, the world has recently seen the potential of solar power in decarbonizing economies and transforming rural livelihoods in developing countries. A new technology, such as solar power photovoltaics, is highly divisible and, therefore, can be easily introduced to overcome the lack of sustainable electricity supply. In 2020–2021, we implemented an intervention to rebuild rural livelihoods in conflict-affected northeast Nigeria by building solar-powered cold storage facilities that can reduce food loss and increase consumption of perishable, micronutrient-rich horticulture products; increase incomes of market agents and producers; and improve employment. The intervention brought a significant increase in the number of days that horticulture products remain fresh, market sales for cold storage users, and the amount of vegetables available to the local population. Cost-benefit analysis showed a significant net economic gain in the long-run. Our example shows that a technological innovation, which overcomes the lack of an essential investment for development, can trigger economic transformation.",SpringerLink,"Yamauchi, F., Takeshima, H.",0,"Explore the full paper-https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-5542-6_24",,,"Innovation for inclusive and sustainable growth of domestic food value chains","Community development and infrastructure","Fruits and vegetables","Empirical study",Nigeria,"Innovations in the enabling environment: Infrastructure development","SDG 10 - Reduce Inequalities",Services,"Post-harvest: storage","Journal article",1,"2022-12-02 13:26:14",theAdmin,2022-12-02T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2170,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2170,yes,NGA

"How food systems change (or not): Governance implications for system transformation processes","This paper argues that supporting food system transformation requires more than obtaining science-based understanding and analysis of how components in the system interact. We argue that changing the emergent properties of food systems (what we call food system synthesis) is a socio-political challenge that is affected by competing views regarding system boundaries and purposes, and limited possibilities for central steering and control. We point to different traditions of 'systems thinking' that each emphasize particular types of interventions for achieving system change, and argue that food systems are best looked at as complex multi-dimensional systems. This implies that we need to move beyond rational engineering approaches to system change, and look for approaches that anticipate and accommodate inherent social tensions and struggles in processes of changing food system dynamics and outcomes. Through a case study on the persistence of an undesired emergent property of food systems (i.e. poverty) we demonstrate that a multi-level perspective (MLP) on system transformation is useful in understanding both how food system transformation has happened in the past, and how desirable transformations is prevented from happening today. Based on such insights we point to key governance strategies and principles that may be used to influence food system transformation as a non-linear and long-term process of competition, negotiation and reconfiguration. Such strategies include the creation and nurturing of diversity in the system, as well as process interventions aimed at visioning, destabilization and formation of discourse coalitions. Such governance interventions imply a considerable re-orientation of investments in food system transformation as well as a rethinking of the role that policy-makers may play in either altering or reproducing undesirable system outcomes.",Springer,"Cees, L., Boogaard, B.K., Atta-Krah, K.",0,"Explore More-https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8211938/",,,Other,"Nutrition, health and food security",,"Synthesis paper",Global,"Innovations in the enabling environment: Sustainable development policies","SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 2 - Zero Hunger|SDG 10 - Reduce Inequalities",,,"Journal article",1,"2022-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2022-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2284,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2284,no,
"Assessing the trade and welfare effects of certification schemes: The case of GlobalGAP in Ghana's mango sector","This study analyzes the trade and welfare effects of GlobalGAP certification using primary data collected from 224 mango farmers in Southern Ghana. The multivariate probit model and an endogenous switching regression (ESR) model are used to estimate the effects of certification on the choice of marketing channels, quantity sold and income. The results show that certified farmers are less likely to supply to local traders and more likely to sell to industrial processors and the export market. The study found that certification increased quantity sold to high-value markets by 12% for certified farmers. GlobalGAP certification also has the potential to increase income by 20% more for farmers who opt to be certified. The study recommends that government and development partners should contribute to the development of the technical and financial capacities of farmers in order to enhance farmers’ participation in certification schemes.",Elsevier,"Akrong, R., Akorsu, A.D., Jha, P., Agyenim, J.B.",0,,,,"Evidensia platform","Poverty reduction and livelihoods|Agribusiness profitability: market access|Agribusiness profitability: output prices","Fruits and vegetables: mango",,Ghana,"Product or farm level: Product certification","SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth|SDG 12 - Responsible Production and Consumption",Crops,"Primary production: crops","Research report",1,"2022-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2022-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2154,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2154,no,GHA

It first introduces the key concepts of trade, global value chains, sustainable development, their interrelatedness and their importance for developing countries. It argues that global value chains can be governed in a way which enhances economic, social and environmental â€˜upgradingâ€™, i.e. a process by which negative social and environmental consequences are addressed in global value chains and which contributes to better protection of social and environmental standards. It shows that upgrading through the governance of global value chains directly allows producers in developing countries to access global markets and reap their potential benefits contributing in this way to economic development in developing countries.","UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development)","Marx, A., Dietz, T., Elamin, N.E.A., de Cordoba, S.F.",0,,,,"Evidensia platform","Poverty reduction and livelihoods|Agribusiness profitability: market access|Agribusiness profitability: sales|Agribusiness profitability: output prices",,"Synthesis paper",Global,"Product or farm level: Product certification","SDG 12 - Responsible Production and Consumption",Multi-sector,,"Research report",1,"2021-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2021-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2155,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2155,no,

While acknowledging the importance of setting reasonable end-of-project targets and outcomes, we argue that the achievement of outcomes and impacts, particularly in complex contexts, requires adaptive management and acknowledgment that significant positive outcomes and impacts may occur after the project funding cycle is complete. The paper presents a practitioner-developed approach to scaling AR4D innovations called Impact Tracking (IT). We illustrate IT in practice by presenting three case studies from Ethiopia in which IT proved crucial to achieving impact. The paper concludes by drawing lessons from the case studies and discussing what implications IT may have for development practitioners.","International Water Management Institute","Child, K., Desta, G., Douthwaite, B., Haileslassie, A., van Rooyen, A., Tamene, L., Uhlenbrook, S.",0,"Explore More-https://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/publications/wle-legacy-series/wle-legacy-series-1/",,,Other,"Poverty reduction and livelihoods|Household income: farm income",,"Empirical study",Ethiopia,"Innovations within the supply chain: Value chain infrastructure","SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 2 - Zero Hunger|SDG 10 - Reduce Inequalities",Crops,"Primary production: crops","Journal article",1,"2021-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2021-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2279,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2279,no,ETH
"Determinants of market participation decision by smallholder haricot bean (phaseolus vulgaris l.) farmers in Northwest Ethiopia","Current knowledge on product marketing in Ethiopia is poor and inadequate for designing and implementing policies to overcome problems in the marketing system. This study was conducted to identify the factors influencing the market participation decision of smallholder haricot bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) farmers in Northwest Ethiopia. Survey data were collected from 312 smallholder farmers and analyzed using Heckman’s two-step econometric model that estimates probit model in the first step and regression model with the parameters estimated using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method in the second step. The educational status, non-farm income from nonfarm employment, number of extension contacts, gender, improved seed use, chemical fertilizer, and farmers' perception of land degradation were the significant variables affecting the market participation decision of smallholder farmers. The amount of haricot bean output supplied to the market were influenced by age, experience, livestock holding, nonfarm income, extension contacts, gender, market access, and membership in marketing association. Participation in the market can be improved by providing training and education regarding the production and marketing of haricot bean output and increasing farmers' contact with extension agents.","Taylor and Francis","Andaregie, A., Astatkie, T., & Teshome, F.",0,"Explore More-https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311932.2021.1879715",,,Other,"Poverty reduction and livelihoods|Household income: farm income","Pulses: beans","Empirical study",Ethiopia,"Innovations within the supply chain: Value chain infrastructure","SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 2 - Zero Hunger|SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth|SDG 10 - Reduce Inequalities",Crops,"Post-harvest: wholesale trade|Post-harvest: retail trade","Journal article",1,"2021-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2021-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2293,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2293,no,ETH

"Adaptive scaling to achieve system transformation in One CGIAR.","The food system is defined as a network of actors, their institutions and activities related to the production, value addition and consumption of food. It is a complex system that operates across scales (i.e., from farm to local, national, regional and global), time, and institutional and regulatory frameworks (Hall and Dijkman 2019). Therefore, the system is influenced by a set of practices, relationships, values and rules and their interconnections that form the underlying structures and supporting mechanisms. System transformation, therefore, refers to bringing about lasting change by altering the underlying structures and supporting mechanisms (Abercrombie et al. 2015), and perpetuating this change so that it becomes the ‘new normal’ (Woltering et al. 2019). Triggering system transformation requires multiactor and stakeholder engagement and partnership in the scaling ecosystem to realize win-win collaboration, collective action, interactive learning and capacity development (Minh et al. 2020). Stimulating system transformation requires identifying the socio-technical innovation bundles that fit, designing and implementing effective scaling strategies, and fostering multi-actor engagement and partnership to achieve impact and trigger change across scales.","International Water Management Institute","CGIAR Research Program on Water, Land and Ecosystems (WLE)",0,"Explore More-https://cgspace.cgiar.org/bitstream/handle/10568/113924/Adaptive%20scaling%20to%20achieve%20system%20transformation%20in%20One%20CGIAR.pdf?sequence=11&amp;isAllowed=y",,,Other,"Nutrition, health and food security",,"Synthesis paper",Global,,"SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 2 - Zero Hunger|SDG 10 - Reduce Inequalities",,,"Policy brief",1,"2021-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2021-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2282,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2282,no,

"Quiet Revolution by SMEs in the Midstream of Value Chains in Developing Regions: Wholesale Markets, Wholesalers, Logistics, and Processing","Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the midstream (processors, wholesalers and wholesale markets, and logistics) segments of transforming value chains have proliferated rapidly over the past several decades in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Their spread has been most rapid in the long transitional stage between the traditional and modern stages, when value chains grow long and developed with urbanization but are still fragmented, before consolidation. Most of Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, and parts of the other regions, are in that stage. The midstream SMEs in output and input value chains are important to overall food security (moving about 65% of food consumed in Africa and South Asia), and to employment, farmers, poor consumers, and the environment. The midstream of value chains is neglected in the national and international debates as the “missing middle.” We found that it is indeed not missing but rather hidden from the debate, hence “the hidden middle.” The midstream SMEs grow quickly and succeed where enabling conditions are present. Our main policy recommendations are to support the SMEs further growth through a focus on infrastructure investment, in particular on wholesale markets and roads, a reduction of policy-related constraints such as excessive red tape, and regulation for food safety and good commercial practices.",Springer,"Reardon, T., Liverpool-Tasie, S., Minten, B.",0,"Explore More-https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12571-021-01224-1",,,Other,"Income and employment opportunities: employment|Nutrition, health and food security: Food security/insecurity",,"Synthesis paper",Global,"Innovations in the enabling environment: Infrastructure development","SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 2 - Zero Hunger|SDG 10 - Reduce Inequalities",,"Post-harvest: wholesale trade|Post-harvest: logistics|Post-harvest: retail trade","Journal article",1,"2021-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2021-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2270,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2270,no,
"Effects of Fairtrade on farm household food security and living standards: Insights from Côte d'Ivoire","Fairtrade certification has recently gained in importance for various export crops produced in developing countries. One of Fairtrade's main objectives is to improve the social conditions of smallholder farmers. Previous research showed that Fairtrade has positive effects on farmers' sales prices and incomes in many situations. However, more detailed analysis of the effects on food security and other dimensions of household living standard is rare. Here, we use data from a survey of cocoa farmers in Côte d’Ivoire to analyze how Fairtrade certification affects aggregate household consumption expenditures and the consumption of specific types of consumer goods and services. We also differentiate between poor and non-poor households. Regression models with instrumental variables suggest that Fairtrade increases aggregate consumption expenditures by 9% on average. For poor households, the effect is even larger (14%). These effects are driven by increases in non-food expenditures. We do not find significant effects on food consumption and dietary diversity. In poor households, Fairtrade primarily increases spending on other basic needs such as housing and clothing, whereas in non-poor households positive effects on education and transportation expenditures are found. We conclude that Fairtrade improves farm household living standards, but not food security.",Elsevier,"Knößlsdorfer, I., Sellare, J., Qaim, M.",0,,,,"Evidensia platform","Agribusiness profitability: output prices|Household income: farm income|Nutrition, health and food security|Poverty reduction and livelihoods|Nutrition, health and food security: Food security/insecurity","Industrial crops: cocoa","Empirical study","Côte d’Ivoire","Product or farm level: Product certification","SDG 2 - Zero Hunger",Crops,"Primary production: crops","Journal article",1,"2021-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2021-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2165,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2165,no,
"A review of evidence on gender equality, women's empowerment, and food systems","Achieving gender equality and women’s empowerment in food systems can result in greater food security and better nutrition, and in more just, resilient, and sustainable food systems for all. This paper uses a scoping review to assess the current evidence on pathways between gender equality, women’s empowerment, and food systems. The paper uses an adaptation of the food systems framework to organize the evidence and identify where evidence is strong, and where gaps remain. Results show strong evidence on women’s differing access to resources, shaped and reinforced by contextual social gender norms, and on links between women’s empowerment and maternal education and important outcomes, such as nutrition and dietary diversity. However, evidence is limited on issues such as gender considerations in food systems for women in urban areas and in aquaculture value chains, best practices, and effective pathways for engaging men in the process of women’s empowerment in food systems, and for addressing issues related to migration, crises, and indigenous food systems. And while there are gender-informed evaluation studies that examine the effectiveness of gender- and nutrition-sensitive agricultural programs, evidence to indicate the long-term sustainability of such impacts remains limited. The paper recommends keys areas for investment: improving women’s leadership and decision-making in food systems, promoting equal and positive gender norms, improving access to resources, and building cross-contextual research evidence on gender and food systems.","Center for Development Research (ZEF) in cooperation with the Scientific Group for the UN Food System Summit 2021","Jemimah, N., Eissler, S., Malapit, H., Meinzen-Dick, R., Bryan, E., Quisumbing, A.",0,,,,"Evidensia platform","Nutrition, health and food security|Poverty reduction and livelihoods|Gender equality, youth and social inclusion|Nutrition, health and food security: Food security/insecurity|Nutrition, health and food security: Nutrition/undernourishment/malnutrition|Income and employment opportunities: income diversification",,"Synthesis paper",Global,,"SDG 2 - Zero Hunger|SDG 5 - Gender Equality",Multi-sector,,,1,"2021-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2021-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2153,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2153,no,

Cross-cutting review of the publications leads to several insights and critically questions dominant ways of understanding and guiding scaling of innovation in the agricultural research for development sector. This provides a starting point for proposing more outcome-oriented scaling as a third wave of understanding and guiding scaling, beyond technology adoption (first wave) and the scaling of innovation (second wave).

"Climate change adaptation, food security, and attitudes toward risk among smallholder coffee farmers in Nicaragua","Farmers’ livelihoods are uniquely vulnerable to climate change, and taking adaptive measures to changing environmental conditions constitutes one of the most important pathways for protecting them. Their willingness and capacity to adopt improved practices and technologies, their cognitive and behavioural preferences, and the institutional response mechanisms will go a long way in determining their success in their adaptation to climate change. This study presents results of an analysis of the vulnerabilities of smallholder coffee producers in Nicaragua to climate change. It uses descriptive analyses and experimental risk games to evaluate the preferences and attitudes of coffee producers in the context of their adaptation to climate change. It shows that food insecure households are more risk-averse than food-secure households and that much work is needed in the sector to ensure equity and improve institutional capacity. For households in chronic poverty, conventional risk management strategies simply may not be enough.

"Scaling agricultural mechanization services in smallholder farming systems: Case studies from sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America.","There is great untapped potential for farm mechanization to support rural development initiatives in low- and middle-income countries. As technology transfer of large machinery from high-income countries was ineffective during the 1980s and 90s, mechanization options were developed appropriate to resource poor farmers cultivating small and scattered plots. More recently, projects that aim to increase the adoption of farm machinery have tended to target service providers rather than individual farmers. This paper uses the Scaling Scan tool to assess three project case studies designed to scale different Mechanization Service Provider Models (MSPMs) in Mexico, Zimbabwe, and Bangladesh. It provides a useful framework to assess the gap between international lessons learned on scaling captured in forty tactical questions over ten “scaling ingredients” as perceived by stakeholders involved in the projects, as well as private sector actors and government employees. Although at first sight the case studies seem to successfully reach high numbers of end users, the assessment exposes issues around the sustainable and transformative nature of the interventions. These are highly influenced by the design of the projects and by the environment and context of the intervention areas. Across the three case studies, large-scale adoption of the models was found to be hampered by lack of finance to set up MSPMs and insufficient collaboration among the value chain actors to strengthen and foster Mechanization Service Provider (MSP) entrepreneurs. Applying a scaling perspective on each case study project exposed important lessons on minimizing project dependencies. Positive examples include integration of capacity development materials in vocational training centers in Zimbabwe, promotion of MSPMs by other donors in East Africa and levering of nearly USD six million of private sector investment in appropriate machinery in Bangladesh. On the other hand, there is still a high dependency on the projects in terms of coaching of service providers, facilitating collaboration along the value chain, and provision of leadership and advocacy to address issues at governance level. These results have important implications for similar development interventions aimed at increasing smallholder access to mechanization services at scale and is to our knowledge the first cross-continental assessment of these issues to date.",Elsevier,"Van Loon, J., Woltering, L., Krupnik, T.J., Baudron, F., Boa, M., and Govaerts, B.",0,"Explore More-https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X18314914",,,Other,"Poverty reduction and livelihoods",,"Empirical study",Mexico|Zimbabwe|Bangladesh,"Innovations within the supply chain: Value chain infrastructure","SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 10 - Reduce Inequalities",,"Primary production: crops","Journal article",1,"2020-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2020-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2399,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2399,no,MEX|ZWE|BGD
"Scaling Readiness: Science and practice of an approach to enhance the impact of research for development","Scaling of innovations is a key requirement for addressing societal challenges in sectors such as health, agriculture, and the environment. Research for development (R4D) programs, projects and other interventions struggle to make particular innovations go to scale. Current conceptualizations of scaling are often too simplistic; more systemic and multidimensional perspectives, frameworks and measures are needed. There is a gap between new complexity-aware theories and perspectives on innovation, and tools and approaches that can improve strategic and operational decision-making in R4D interventions that aim to scale innovations. This paper aims to bridge that gap by developing the key concepts and measures of Scaling Readiness. Scaling Readiness is an approach that encourages critical reflection on how ready innovations are for scaling and what appropriate actions could accelerate or enhance scaling. Scaling Readiness provides action-oriented support for (1) characterizing the innovation and innovation system; (2) diagnosing the current readiness and use of innovations as a proxy for their readiness to scale; (3) developing strategy to overcome bottlenecks for scaling; (4) facilitating and negotiating multi-stakeholder innovation and scaling processes; and (5) navigating and monitoring the implementation process to allow for adaptive management. Scaling Readiness has the potential to support evidence-based scaling strategy design, implementation and monitoring, and – if applied across multiple interventions – can be used to manage a portfolio of innovation and scaling investments.",Elsevier,"Sartas, M., Schut, M., Proietti, C., Thiele, G., and Leeuwis, C.",0,"Explore More-https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X19314477",,,Other,"Poverty reduction and livelihoods|Household income: farm income",,"Synthesis paper",Global,"Innovations within the supply chain: Value chain infrastructure","SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 2 - Zero Hunger|SDG 10 - Reduce Inequalities",,,"Journal article",1,"2020-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2020-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2285,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2285,no,

"Women Role in Agricultural Value Chain:Review in Ethiopia","Ethiopia is a country where more than 85% of its population depend on rain fed agriculture. Agriculture is the back bone of the national economy. Both men and women have been playing a significant role in the development of agricultural production. This paper draws on the available empirical evidence to review in which areas and to what degree women participate along agricultural value chain. Women make essential contributions to the agricultural and rural economies in all developing countries. Their roles vary considerably between and within regions. Their activities typically include producing agricultural crops, processing and marketing. Rural women often manage complex households and pursue multiple livelihood strategies. Their activities typically include producing agricultural crops, tending animals, processing and preparing food, working for wages in agricultural or other rural enterprises, collecting fuel and water, engaging in trade and marketing, caring for family members and maintaining their homes. However, evidence suggests that women tend to lose income and control as a product moves from the farm to the market. Women participation influenced by social, cultural, demographic, institutional and economic factors. So, it needs both governmental and non-governmental organizations intervention to support, encourage and give priority for increasing production, processing and marketing of agricultural products and minimize differences among women and men.","International Institute for Science, Technology and Education ","Belete, M.",0,"Explore More-https://iiste.org/Journals/index.php/JCSD/article/view/45993",,,Other,"Women's empowerment|Gender equality, youth and social inclusion",,"Empirical study",Ethiopia,"Innovations in the enabling environment: Sustainable development policies","SDG 5 - Gender Equality|SDG 10 - Reduce Inequalities",Crops,"Post-harvest: wholesale trade|Post-harvest: retail trade|Primary production: crops","Journal article",1,"2019-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2019-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2299,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2299,no,ETH
"Scaling modern technology or scaling exclusion? The socio-political dynamics of accessing in malt barley innovation in two highland communities in Southern Ethiopia","In this article we explore whether and how the dynamics of access shape the scaling of modern agricultural technologies. It is based on the experience of an agricultural research for development (AR4D) project called CASCAPE, which aims to validate and scale agricultural best practices for smallholder farmers in Ethiopia. The socio-political dynamics of external interventions are often taken for granted contextual factors in AR4D projects. By contrast, this article takes this context as the point of departure for its analysis. The aim of this in-depth case study is to unpack the concept of access as condition for scaling of agricultural technologies. We identify and analyse the mechanisms that determine access to the various components of a malt barley technology package which was introduced in two highland communities in southern Ethiopia (and later ‘scaled’ to a range of other communities). Our research approach is technographic, implying that we consider the technology to contain both material and social components. The findings suggest that social and clan-based exchange mechanisms (such as clan-based loyalty, reciprocity and vertical accountability) are often rendered invisible even though they are of critical importance in governing access to the material and social components of modern agricultural technologies. Ignoring this socio-political context in the malt barley interventions resulted in an unintended scaling effect in terms of widening the social and economic gap between a few better off farmers and a larger group of poor farmers. The paper thus provides evidence that the socio-political dynamics of access to technology can have an important influence on its wide spread application and may complicate efforts to scale the uptake of technology. Paying more attention to such processes would help to improve the effectiveness of AR4D efforts.",Elsevier,"de Roo, N., Almekinders, C., Leeuwis, C., Tefera, T.",0,"Explore More-https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X18309843",,,Other,"Poverty reduction and livelihoods|Household income: farm income",,"Empirical study",Ethiopia,"Innovations within the supply chain: Value chain infrastructure","SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 2 - Zero Hunger|SDG 10 - Reduce Inequalities",Crops,"Primary production: crops","Journal article",1,"2019-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2019-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2280,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2280,no,ETH
"Effects of Voluntary Sustainability Standards and Related Supply Chain Initiatives on Yield, Price, Costs and Income in the Agriculture Sector","Using a modified systematic review approach, the report authors reviewed 51 studies that examined the impact of agricultural VSS participation on five livelihood-related outcomes: yield, input costs, crop prices, crop income, and net household income. In all, 208 individual results for these five outcomes were analyzed. The findings show that the volume of research on this subject has increased over time, with a peak in 2016. Africa was the most frequently-studied region, coffee was the most frequently-studied crop, and Fairtrade was the most frequently-studied VSS, results that are consistent with previous reviews conducted by Oya et al. and DeFries et al. Over half of the results that examined the price farmers received and the income they earned from their certified crop found that VSS-certified farms performed significantly better than non-certified farms. Although critical to our understanding of farmers' financial wellbeing, net household income was the least-studied outcome, and had the highest proportion of results showing no difference between VSS-certified and non-certified, at just over two-thirds. Net household income was significantly higher on VSS-certified farms in one-quarter of results. Results suggest that additional research is needed to clarify the influence of farmer cooperatives, disentangle the relationship between yield, price, and net household income, and better understand the tradeoff between crop specialization and off-farm employment.",Evidensia,Evidensia,0,"Explore the full paper-https://www.evidensia.eco/resources/188/effects-of-voluntary-sustainability-standards-and-related-supply-chain-initiatives-on-yield-price-costs-and-income-in-the-agriculture-sector/",,,"Evidensia platform","Agribusiness profitability: input costs|Household income|Agribusiness profitability: output prices|Agribusiness profitability: yields",,"Synthesis paper",Global,"Product or farm level: Product certification","SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth|SDG 12 - Responsible Production and Consumption",Crops,"Primary production: crops","Research report",1,"2019-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2019-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2124,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2124,no,
"Scaling–from reaching many to sustainable systems change at scale: a critical shift in mindset.","Countless development projects have piloted solutions that could make a difference if only applied at scale. The reality is that these pilot projects hardly ever reach the intended scale to contribute significantly to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this paper, we argue that two major problems undermine efforts to achieve scale in development projects. First, pilot projects are usually set up and managed in very controlled environments that make it very difficult to transition to the real world at scale. Second, poor conceptual and methodological clarity on what scaling is and how it can be pursued often results in a narrow focus on reaching numbers. Counting household adoption at the end of a grant project is a poor metric of whether these people can and will sustain adoption after the project closes, let alone if adoption will reach others and actually contributes to improved livelihoods. We advocate for a broader view on scaling that more accurately reflects the transformational change agenda of the SDGs: from reaching many to a process aiming to achieve sustainable systems change at scale. Sustainable systems change alters a sufficient number of key drivers (incentives, rules, etc.) such that the system that once perpetuated a “problem” now instead perpetuates a “solution.” This has implications on the way projects are designed and implemented. Rather than focusing on changing conditions within the project context, projects should serve as vehicles for societal change. This means that projects make most sense if designed as part of a multisector, long-term programmatic approach. Treating scaling as a transformation process helps deal with the necessary coevolution of organizational and institutional arrangements, along with the innovations in a technology or practice. To help address scaling, we present a number of frameworks that guide users to assess the scalability of innovations, design for scale from the onset of projects, and systematically think through key elements, ingredients, or success factors. We conclude that scaling requires different skills, approaches, and ways of collaborating than those required for successful implementation of pilot projects. It calls for development actors to have a mindset that allows them to creatively navigate multiple overlapping systems; likewise, they must develop a clear vision about which elements in the system the actors can and cannot address, and about where they need to collaborate strategically to exert influence. Although it is tempting to hope for the silver bullet solution that changes the world, we argue for an approach that takes scaling serious in its own right and recognizes the complexities involved in facilitating a transition to a new “normal.”",Elsevier,"Woltering, L., Fehlenberg, K., Gerard, B., Ubels, J., and Cooley, L.",0,"Explore More-https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/agisys/v176y2019ics0308521x18314392.html",,,Other,"Poverty reduction and livelihoods|Household income: farm income",,"Synthesis paper",Global,"Innovations in the enabling environment: Sustainable development policies","SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 2 - Zero Hunger|SDG 10 - Reduce Inequalities",,"Primary production: crops","Journal article",1,"2019-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2019-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2288,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2288,no,

This article explores the issue through a systematic review of the extant scholarship, complemented by a selective review of key studies examining the wider socio-economic effects of certification that may affect food security indirectly. To guide the analysis, we identify three main causal mechanisms â€“ economic, land use and land rights, and gender effects â€“ that link certification to local food security. Our review finds that food security remains a blind spot in the literature on certification impacts.

"The feasibility of picture-based insurance (PBI): Smartphone pictures for affordable crop insurance","Smallholder farmers are increasingly exposed to weather extremes but lack access to affordable insurance products for catastrophic crop damage. This paper analyzes the feasibility of Picture-Based Insurance (PBI) as a low-cost tool to improve coverage. PBI verifies insurance claims using smartphone pictures of insured plots, taken by farmers themselves, to minimize asymmetric information and costs of claims verification, while reducing basis risk compared to index-based insurance. A pilot implementation in the rice-wheat belt of India speaks to PBI being a feasible and valuable innovation to reduce downside basis risk in index insurance: nearly two-thirds of trained farmers took at least four pictures (roughly one per growth stage), which was considered sufficient for loss assessment; severe damage was visible from smartphone pictures in 71 percent of affected sites; and this was a significant improvement over alternative index-based products, which identified severe damage in at most 34 percent of affected sites.",Elsevier,"Ceballos, F., Kramer, B., Robles, M.",0,"Explore More-https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352728518300812",,,Other,"Climate adaptation and mitigation|Climate change adaptation: climate resilience",,"Empirical study",India,"Innovations within the supply chain: Financial services","SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 2 - Zero Hunger|SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth",Crops,"Primary production: crops","Journal article",1,"2019-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2019-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2278,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2278,no,IND
"The dynamics of climate change adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa: A review of climate-smart agriculture among small-scale farmers","Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) as a credible alternative to tackle food insecurity under the changing climate is gaining wide acceptance. However, many developing countries have realized that concepts that have been recommended as solutions to existing problems are not suitable in their contexts. This paper synthesizes a subset of literature on CSA in the context of small-scale agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa as it relates to the need for CSA, factors influencing CSA adoption, and the challenges involved in understanding and scaling up CSA. Findings from the literature reveal that age, farm size, the nature of farming, and access to extension services influence CSA adoption. Many investments in climate adaptation projects have found little success because of the sole focus on the technology-oriented approach whereby innovations are transferred to farmers whose understanding of the local farming circumstances are limited. Climate-smart agriculture faces the additional challenge of a questionable conceptual understanding among policymakers as well as financing bottlenecks. This paper argues that the prospects of CSA in small-scale agriculture rest on a thorough socio-economic analysis that recognizes the heterogeneity of the small farmer environment and the identification and harnessing of the capacities of farming households for its adoption and implementation.","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","Abegunde, V.

"Asymmetric Information and Middleman Margins: An Experiment with Indian Potato Farmers","West Bengal potato farmers cannot directly access wholesale markets and do not knowwholesale prices. Local middlemen earn large margins; pass-through from wholesale to farmgate prices is negligible. When we informed farmers in randomly chosen villages about wholesale prices, average farmgate sales and prices were unaffected, but pass-through to farmgate prices increased. These results can be explained by a model where farmers bargain ex post with village middlemen, with the outside option of selling to middlemen outside the village. They are inconsistent with standard oligopolistic models of pass-through, search frictions, or risk-sharing contracts.","Harvard Kennedy School","Mitra, Sandip, Mookherjee, Dilip, Torero, Maximo, Mitra,S., Mookherjee, D., Torero, M., Visaria, S.",0,"Explore More-https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/29657/rest_a_00699.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y",,,Other,"Poverty reduction and livelihoods|Agribusiness profitability: output prices",,"Empirical study",India,,"SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 10 - Reduce Inequalities",Crops,"Post-harvest: wholesale trade","Journal article",1,"2018-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2018-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2274,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2274,no,IND
"Do private coffee standards 'walk the talk' in improving socio-economic and environmental sustainability?","This study assesses the effectiveness of private coffee standards in improving both environmental and socio-economic sustainability in Uganda. The authors combine socio-economic survey data with ecological field inventory data from certified and non-certified producers, finding that coffee standards in Uganda are not as socio-economically and environmentally impactful as consumers expect. Whilst certification can improve either a farm’s socio-economic or environmental performance, they rarely address both. Multiple certification is found to be counterproductive, and it is recommended that improving standard design to ensure productivity within ecological boundaries would be more effective in mitigating the observed trade-offs between socio-economic and environmental outcomes.",Elsevier,"Vanderhaegen, K., Akoyi, K.T., Dekoninck, W., Jocque, R., Muys, B., Verbist, B., Maertens, M.",0,,,,"Evidensia platform","Climate adaptation and mitigation|Poverty reduction and livelihoods|Climate mitigation: soil carbon sequestration|Household income: farm income|Agribusiness profitability: yields|Agribusiness profitability: output prices","Industrial crops: coffee",,Uganda,"Product or farm level: Product certification","SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth|SDG 12 - Responsible Production and Consumption|SDG 13 - Climate Action|SDG 15 - Life on Land",Crops,"Primary production: crops","Journal article",1,"2018-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2018-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2157,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2157,no,UGA

"Agricultural Transformation in Africa? Assessing the Evidence in Ethiopia","Despite significant efforts, Africa has struggled to imitate the rapid agricultural growth that took place in Asia in the 1960s and 1970s. As a rare but important exception, Ethiopia’s agriculture sector recorded remarkable rapid growth during 2004–14. This paper explores this rapid change in the agriculture sector of this important country – the second most populous in Africa. We review the evidence on agricultural growth and decompose the contributions of modern inputs to growth using an adjusted Solow decomposition model. We also highlight the key pathways Ethiopia followed to achieve its agricultural growth. We find that land and labor use expanded significantly and total factor productivity grew by about 2.3% per year over the study period. Moreover, modern input use more than doubled, explaining some of this growth. The expansion in modern input use appears to have been driven by high government expenditures on the agriculture sector, including agricultural extension, but also by an improved road network, higher rural education levels, and favorable international and local price incentives.",Elsevier,"Bachewe, F.

"Effects of certification schemes for agricultural production on socio-economic outcomes in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic review","The rise of voluntary standards and their associated certification for agricultural products is a well-established phenomenon in the contemporary dynamics of agricultural trade. Supply chain management is increasingly influenced by a proliferation of standards, and by the organisations setting and monitoring them over a growing number of products. While the objectives of standards and certification schemes (CS) vary, the focus of this review is on social sustainability standards, which are closely related to ethical trading and to schemes that focus on socio-economic outcomes of participants, essentially agricultural producers (particularly smallholders) and wage workers, whether employed by corporate plantations or individual agricultural producers. This systematic review addresses the extent to which, and under what conditions, CS for agricultural products result in higher levels of socio-economic wellbeing for agricultural producers and workers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The primary review question is: What are the effects of certification schemes for sustainable agricultural production, and their associated interventions, in terms of endpoint socio-economic outcomes for household/individual wellbeing in low and middle income countries? The subsidiary review question is: Under what circumstances and why do certification schemes for agricultural commodities have the intended and/or unintended effects? What are the barriers and facilitators to such certification's intended and/or unintended effects? The authors found that the impact of certification schemes on yields is mixed. Prices for some certified products increased and farmer income from the sale of the certified product was slightly higher. However, the average household incomes and asset ownership of farmers did not increase. They also found that the average workers' wages were no different or slightly lower. There was a significant impact on school attendance in Africa, but not in Asia and Latin American and the Caribbean.","Campbell Collaboration","Oya, C., Schaefer, F., Skalidou, D., McCosker, C., Langer, L.",0,"Explore the full paper-https://www.evidensia.eco/resources/187/effects-of-certification-schemes-for-agricultural-production-on-socio-economic-outcomes-in-low-and-middle-income-countries-a-systematic-review/",,,"Evidensia platform","Poverty reduction and livelihoods|Gender equality, youth and social inclusion|Household income: labour income|Household income: farm income|Household income: non-farm income|Income and employment opportunities: wages|Agribusiness profitability: output prices|Agribusiness profitability: market access|Agribusiness profitability: assets|Agribusiness profitability: yields|Education and training|Decent working conditions: occupational health and safety","Fruits and vegetables: grape|Fruits and vegetables: black pepper|Fruits and vegetables: lychee|Grains: rice|Industrial crops: cocoa|Industrial crops: coffee|Industrial crops: cotton|Industrial crops: flowers|Industrial crops: banana|Industrial crops: tea|Honey","Synthesis paper",Chile,"Product or farm level: Product certification","SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 3 - Good Health and Well-Being|SDG 4 - Quality Education|SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth|SDG 12 - Responsible Production and Consumption",Crops,"Primary production: crops","Research report",1,"2017-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2017-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2123,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2123,no,CHL

"What kinds of ‘systems’ are we dealing with? Implications for systems research and scaling. Sustainable Intensification in Smallholder Agriculture.","This chapter deals with intertwined configurations in which bio-material relations are mediated by social and symbolic phenomena. It discusses how such configurations may change, and what roles research may play in this when taking into account some special features of intertwined configurations that complicate deliberate attempts to foster change. It is argued that, in order to help realize public values, research needs to become a mechanism which informs adaptation to ever changing conditions, and leverage the emergence of novel bio-material, social and symbolic opportunities. This requires a considerable change in the way research processes are predominantly organized and embedded in society. The chapter describes three basic types that can be combined with each other: research aimed at describing and understanding complexity; research aimed at identifying key leverages, opportunities and constraints; and research aimed at enlarging variation in society.

"Is voluntary certification of tropical agricultural commodities achieving sustainability goals for small-scale producers? A review of the evidence","Over the last several decades, voluntary certification programs have become a key approach to promote sustainable supply chains for agricultural commodities. These programs provide premiums and other benefits to producers for adhering to environmental and labor practices established by the certifying entities. Following the principles of Cochrane Reviews used in health sciences, the study asseseses evidence to evaluate whether voluntary certification of tropical agricultural commodities (bananas, cocoa, coffee, oil palm, and tea) has achieved environmental benefits and improved economic and social outcomes for small-scale producers at the level of the farm household.","IOP Science","DeFries, R.S., Fanzo, J., Mondal, P., Remans, R., Wood, S.A.",0,"Explore the full paper-https://www.evidensia.eco/resources/968/is-voluntary-certification-of-tropical-agricultural-commodities-achieving-sustainability-goals-for-small-scale-producers-a-review-of-the-evidence/",,,"Evidensia platform","Nutrition, health and food security|Nutrition, health and food security: Food security/insecurity|Poverty reduction and livelihoods|Household income: farm income|Agribusiness profitability: output prices|Agribusiness profitability: yields","Industrial crops: cocoa|Industrial crops: coffee|Industrial crops: banana|Industrial crops: tea|Oilseeds & vegetable oils: palm","Synthesis paper",Global,"Product or farm level: Product certification","SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 2 - Zero Hunger|SDG 12 - Responsible Production and Consumption",Crops,"Primary production: crops","Journal article",1,"2017-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2017-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2127,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2127,no,
"Identifying priority value-chains in Ethiopia","This paper uses an economy-wide model to identify agricultural activities and value-chains in Ethiopia whose expansion would be most effective at generating economic growth, reducing national and rural poverty, creating jobs, and diversifying diets. Results indicate that expanding cereals production would continue to contribute positively to national pro-poor growth. However, the analysis suggests that there is no single value-chain that can achieve all policy objectives. Instead, a more balanced portfolio of value-chains would not only enhance agriculture’s future contribution to poverty reduction and economic growth, but also promote faster rural transformation and dietary diversification, both of which are needed to create job opportunities and improve nutrition outcomes over the longer-term. After considering alternative weighting schemes for competing policy goals, the final analysis suggests that vegetables and fruits/tree crops should be considered “priority” value-chains, because these are among the most effective at achieving multiple policy objectives. Other highly-ranked value-chains include oilseeds, tobacco/cotton/tea, and milk/dairy.","International Food Policy Research Institute","Benfica, R., & Thurlow, J.",0,"Explore More-https://ebrary.ifpri.org/utils/getfile/collection/p15738coll2/id/131413/filename/131624.pdf",,,Other,"Poverty reduction and livelihoods|Household income: farm income",,"Modeling study",Ethiopia,"Innovations in the enabling environment: Rules regarding food standards and dietary guidelines","SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 2 - Zero Hunger|SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth|SDG 10 - Reduce Inequalities|SDG 4 - Quality Education",Crops,"Primary production: crops",,1,"2017-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2017-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2297,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2297,no,ETH
"Systemic perspectives on scaling agricultural innovations. A review","Agricultural production involves the scaling of agricultural innovations such as disease-resistant and drought-tolerant maize varieties, zero-tillage techniques, permaculture cultivation practices based on perennial crops and automated milking systems. Scaling agricultural innovations should take into account complex interactions between biophysical, social, economic and institutional factors. Actual methods of scaling are rather empirical and based on the premise of ‘find out what works in one place and do more of the same, in another place’. These methods thus do not sufficiently take into account complex realities beyond the concepts of innovation transfer, dissemination, diffusion and adoption. As a consequence, scaling initiatives often do not produce the desired effect. They may produce undesirable effects in the form of negative spill-overs or unanticipated side effects such as environmental degradation, bad labour conditions of farm workers and loss of control of farming communities over access to genetic resources. Therefore, here, we conceptualise scaling processes as an integral part of a systemic approach to innovation, to anticipate on the possible consequences of scaling efforts. We propose a method that connects the heuristic framework of the multi-level perspective on socio-technical transitions (MLP) to a philosophical ‘modal aspects’ framework, with the objective of elucidating the connectedness between technologies, processes and practices. The resultant framework, the PRactice-Oriented Multi-level perspective on Innovation and Scaling (PROMIS), can inform research and policymakers on the complex dynamics involved in scaling. This is illustrated in relation to three cases in which the framework was applied: scaling agro-ecological practices in Nicaragua, farmer field schools on cocoa cultivation in Cameroon and ‘green rubber’ cultivation in Southwest China.",Springer,"Wigboldus, S., Klerkx, L., Leeuwis, C., Schut, M., Muilerman, S., and Jochemsen, H.",0,"Explore More-https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13593-016-0380-z",,,Other,"Poverty reduction and livelihoods|Household income: farm income",,"Empirical study",Nicaragua|Cameroon|China,"Product or farm level: Farm level technology / agronomic practices (GAPs)","SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 2 - Zero Hunger|SDG 10 - Reduce Inequalities",,"Primary production: crops","Journal article",1,"2016-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2016-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2287,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2287,no,NIC|CMR|CHN
"Towards a framework for unlocking transformative agricultural innovation","The agriculture sector needs to do much better at innovation. Increased demand for food, plateauing productivity, changing patterns of competition and consumption, accelerating climate change, concerns over food safety, and the need to address these issues in a socially and environmentally sustainable manner, are just some of the reasons. These challenges are as relevant to Australia as they are to the world. To improve agricultural innovation, the broad prescription is that research and technology needs to be better coupled with market and policy changes that allow ideas and solutions to be deployed. Australian and international agriculture sector players, however, continue to grapple with questions on how to implement this prescription. In particular, on how to arrive at a mode of innovation that matches the ambition of transforming the performance and sustainability of the sector, both now and in the challenging years ahead. The purpose of this study was to develop a framework to better understand the relationship between different innovation configurations (partnerships, networks, and practices) and impact. Our starting assumption was that while configurations are contextually specific, broad patterns of practices and partnership associated with innovation and impact would emerge. Our logic was that these patterns could then form the basis of a framework to better explain how impact takes place, and point to tools and practices that increase the likelihood of innovation and impact. The study approach was to undertake theory-informed process analysis of the manner in which innovation and impact processes unfold over time. The key analytical perspective used was that of innovation systems, an empirically based concept underpinned by systems and evolutionary economics theories that explains the innovation process as a networked and socially embedded phenomenon, driven by evolutionary learning and systemic change.","Canberra Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation","Hall, A., Dijkman, J., Taylor, B., Williams, L., Jennifer Kelly, J.",0,"Explore More-https://foodsystemsinnovation.org.au/resource/towards-framework-unlocking-transformative-agricultural-innovation",,,Other,"Nutrition, health and food security",,"Empirical study",Australia,"Innovations within the supply chain: Value chain infrastructure","SDG 2 - Zero Hunger",,,"Journal article",1,"2016-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2016-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2281,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2281,no,AUS
"Payment Mechanisms and Antipoverty Programs: Evidence from a Mobile Money Cash Transfer Experiment in Niger","Cash transfers have become an increasingly important component of social protection policies in both developed and developing countries. While such programs are often implemented electronically in developed countries, in many developing countries with weak financial infrastructure, such transfers are distributed manually, resulting in significant costs to program recipients and the public sector alike. The introduction of mobile money systems in many developing countries offers new opportunities for distributing cash transfers. Using data from a randomized experiment of a mobile money cash transfer program in Niger, we find evidence of benefits of this new system: household diet diversity was 9%–16% higher among households who received mobile transfers, and children ate an additional one-third of a meal per day. These results can be partially attributed to time savings associated with mobile transfers, as program recipients spent less time traveling to and waiting for their transfer. They are also associated with shifts in intrahousehold bargaining power for women. These results suggest that electronic transfers may address key logistical challenges in implementing cash transfer programs in developing countries but that sufficient investment in the payments infrastructure is needed.","The University of Chicago","Aker, J.

"The Business Case for Women’s Employment in Agribusiness","This publication aims to fill existing gaps in the literature regarding women’s paid employment in agribusiness, especially with respect to emerging economies. Women workers’ contribution to agribusiness is neither fully understood nor fully valued. The majority of research on women’s participation in agribusiness in emerging economies focuses on small-holder farming contexts, rather than direct employment relationships or women’s participation in management. Furthermore, there is limited analysis of the business gains associated with proactive interventions related to women’s employment. This publication aims to fill these gaps by: Providing a practical look at enterprise-level practices on women’s employment in agribusiness; and Considering how companies can better support women employees and how this can have a positive impact on companies’ bottom line. There is an established business case for private sector investment in women’s employment, which also applies to agribusiness. Companies that invest in women can improve their access to labor and talent, can lower the costs of recruitment and (re)training by reducing labor turnover, can drive innovation and cohesion through having a more diverse workforce and management team, and can improve productivity through stronger teams and employee motivation. Moreover, proven compliance and quality employment can improve access to quality buyers. Thus, agribusiness companies who do not invest in women are potentially missing out on important business gains, and policy-makers are missing a potential lever to open up equal opportunities, and ratchet up labor standards, to support inclusive growth for women workers in agriculture. The focus of this publication is women that are directly employed, paid labor, predominantly among larger employers. While smallholder and outgrower farming has a vital role to play in rural development, it is not the main subject here.","International Finance Corporation","International Finance Corporation",0,"Explore More-https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/cc22958b-7c84-4205-84fd-9041d0425fb5/Women_in_Agribusiness_Report_FINAL_web.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CVID=lIlH5n9",,,Other,"Women's empowerment",,"Empirical study",Global,"Innovations within the supply chain: Inclusive business models","SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 2 - Zero Hunger|SDG 10 - Reduce Inequalities",Crops,"Primary production: crops|Primary production: livestock|Primary production: fishery|Primary production: forestry",,1,"2016-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2016-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2276,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2276,no,
"The role of empowering women and achieving gender equality to the sustainable development of Ethiopia","The purpose of this study is to uncover the role of empowering women and achieving gender equality in the sustainable development of Ethiopia. To achieve this purpose, the researcher employed qualitative methodology, with secondary sources as instruments of data collection. Based on the data analysed, findings of the study show that the role of women across different dimensions of sustainable development is less reflected in the country. The use of a women's labour force in the economic development of the country is minimal. The political sphere of the country is, by and large, reserved for men alone. The place of women in society is also relegated to contributing minimally to the social development of the country. In addition, women's rights are not properly being protected in order for women to participate in various the issues of their country but are subjected to abysmal violations. Moreover, women are highly affected by environmental problems, and less emphasis is given to their participation in protecting the environment. The researcher concluded that unless women are empowered and gender equality is achieved so that women can play their role in economic, social, political, and environmental areas, the country will not achieve sustainable development with the recognition of only men's participation in all these areas. The fact that women constitute half the entire population of the country makes empowering them to be an active part of all development initiatives in the country a compelling circumstance. Hence, this paper calls for the strong commitment of the government to empower women and utilize all the potentials of the country to bring about sustainable development.",Elsevier,"Bayeh, E.",0,"Explore More-https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310593059_The_role_of_empowering_women_and_achieving_gender_equality_in_the_sustainable_development_of_Ethiopia",,,Other,"Women's empowerment|Gender equality, youth and social inclusion",,"Empirical study",Ethiopia,"Innovations in the enabling environment: Sustainable development policies","SDG 5 - Gender Equality|SDG 10 - Reduce Inequalities",,,"Journal article",1,"2016-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2016-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2296,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2296,no,ETH

"ICT based market information services in Kerala – determinants and barriers of adoption","ICT based market information services are getting wide importance as a means of empowering farmers by enabling them to take informed decisions, and in removing information asymmetry. This study analyses determinants of adoption as well as barriers to adoption of ICT based market information services (MIS) in Kerala. Logistic regression model revealed that factors like education, family size, and contact with extension agent positively influenced adoption of ICT based market information services by the farmers whereas income from other sources negatively influenced the adoption. Technical barriers and language were found to be the most important barriers for adoption of MIS followed by irrelevancy of contents, lack of reliability, lack of awareness and cost involved. The study suggested that further efforts to create awareness about such interventions among farmers, providing content in local languages in user friendly manner will increase the adoption of MIS and would remove information asymmetry in agricultural marketing.","New Delhi Publishers","Anoop, Mangalasseri, N.

"The Political Economy of Agricultural Extension Policy in Ethiopia: Economic Growth and Political Control","This article argues that, in Ethiopia, the aim to transform the performance of smallholder agricultural production is driven by the twin imperatives of economic growth and political control. The agricultural extension programme – the largest and fastest growing in the continent – has been central to this strategy, and the unparalleled investment in the extension system has been driven by these twin imperatives. However, there are tensions between the objectives of stimulating agricultural growth, on the one hand, and extensively penetrating society and winning elections, on the other, and these may reduce the returns to this investment. Implications are drawn for wider debates on the reform of agricultural extension.","Overseas Development Institute","Berhanu, K., & Poulton, C.",0,"Explore More-https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/dpr.12082",,,Other,"Poverty reduction and livelihoods|Household income: farm income",,,Ethiopia,"Innovations in the enabling environment: Government extension services","SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 2 - Zero Hunger|SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth|SDG 10 - Reduce Inequalities|SDG 4 - Quality Education",Crops,"Primary production: crops","Journal article",1,"2014-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2014-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2298,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2298,no,ETH
"The political economy of Ethiopian cereal seed systems: State control, market liberalisation and decentralisation","This article explores the political and economic processes governing Ethiopian cereal seed systems. The nature of the Ethiopian agricultural sector, the historical evolution of the seed system and the seed specificities for each cereal crop have resulted in a wide range of actors with diverse linkages and policy processes. A series of economic and political drivers are identified, including top-down state-driven initiatives; agricultural liberalisation and the private sector and political-administrative decentralisation, all of which pull in different directions. It is important that the technocrats, politicians, international donors and supporters understand these political and economic drivers of change and by addressing these conflicts and contradictions, they may improve the chances of designing and implementing more technically effective and socially appropriate policies. This will help establish a vibrant seed system which offers real choices for farmers in terms of seed type, quantity, and quality and delivery time at reasonable prices.",Wiley,"Alemu, D.",0,"Explore More-https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1759-5436.2011.00237.x",,,Other,"Poverty reduction and livelihoods|Household income: farm income",,"Synthesis paper",Ethiopia,"Innovations in the enabling environment: Sustainable development policies","SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 2 - Zero Hunger|SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth|SDG 10 - Reduce Inequalities",Crops,"Primary production: crops","Journal article",1,"2011-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2011-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2292,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2292,no,ETH
"The role of gender in crop value chain in Ethiopia","This paper has demonstrated that site-specific commodity-based gender analysis is essential for understanding the different roles of women and men in the production of specific commodities, marketing and decision-making, and their share in the benefits; identifying potential barriers for women’s and men’s participation in market-led development initiatives and technology adoption The gender analysis findings of the IPMS project across PLWs illustrate how this type of analysis potentially helps to explore challenges and to spot out the entry point for promoting gender equality and women’s empowerment through increasing women’s access to skills, knowledge, assets and increasing women’s participation in market-oriented agricultural production and their control over the benefits.","International Livestock Research Institute","Aregu, L., Puskur, R., & Bishop-Sambrook, C.",0,"Explore More-https://cgspace.cgiar.org/bitstream/handle/10568/21037/roleOfGender.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y",,,Other,"Women's empowerment|Gender equality, youth and social inclusion",,"Empirical study",Ethiopia,"Innovations in the enabling environment: Sustainable development policies","SDG 5 - Gender Equality|SDG 10 - Reduce Inequalities",Crops,"Post-harvest: wholesale trade|Post-harvest: retail trade|Primary production: crops","Journal article",1,"2011-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2011-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2294,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2294,no,ETH

"Information from Markets Near and Far: Mobile Phones and Agricultural Markets in Niger","Price dispersion across markets is common in developing countries. Using novel market and trader-level data, this paper provides estimates of the impact of mobile phones on price dispersion across grain markets in Niger. The introduction of mobile phone service between 2001 and 2006 explains a 10 to 16 percent reduction in grain price dispersion. The effect is stronger for market pairs with higher transport costs","American Economy Association","Aker, J.",0,"Explore More-https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.2.3.46",,,Other,"Poverty reduction and livelihoods|Agribusiness profitability: output prices","Grains: maize|Grains: rice|Grains: wheat","Empirical study",Niger,"Innovations within the supply chain: Market information accessibility","SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 10 - Reduce Inequalities",Crops,"Post-harvest: wholesale trade","Journal article",1,"2010-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2010-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2398,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2398,no,NGA
"Information, Direct Access to Farmers, and Rural Market Performance in Central India","This paper estimates the impact of a change in procurement strategy of a private buyer in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Beginning in October 2000, Internet kiosks and warehouses were established that provide wholesale price information and an alternative marketing channel to soy farmers in the state. Using a new market-level dataset, the estimates suggest a significant increase in soy price after the introduction of kiosks, supporting the predictions of the theoretical model. Moreover, there is a robust increase in area under soy cultivation. The results point toward an improvement in the functioning of rural agricultural markets. ","American Economy Association","Goyal, A.",0,"Explore More-https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.2.3.22",,,Other,"Poverty reduction and livelihoods|Agribusiness profitability: output prices","Oilseeds & vegetable oils: soybeans","Empirical study",India,"Innovations within the supply chain: Market information accessibility","SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 10 - Reduce Inequalities",Crops,"Post-harvest: wholesale trade","Journal article",1,"2010-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2010-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2272,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2272,no,IND
"The Digital Provide: Information (Technology), Market Performance, and Welfare in the South Indian Fisheries Sector","When information is limited or costly, agents are unable to engage in optimal arbitrage. Excess price dispersion across markets can arise, and goods may not be allocated efficiently. In this setting, information technologies may improve market performance and increase welfare. Between 1997 and 2001, mobile phone service was introduced throughout Kerala, a state in India with a large fishing industry. Using microlevel survey data, we show that the adoption of mobile phones by fishermen and wholesalers was associated with a dramatic reduction in price dispersion, the complete elimination of waste, and near-perfect adherence to the Law of One Price. Both consumer and producer welfare increased.","Oxford Academic","Jensen, R.",0,"Explore More-https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/122/3/879/1879540",,,Other,"Poverty reduction and livelihoods|Agribusiness profitability: output prices",,"Empirical study",India,"Innovations within the supply chain: Market information accessibility","SDG 1 - No Poverty|SDG 10 - Reduce Inequalities",Fisheries,"Post-harvest: wholesale trade","Journal article",1,"2007-01-01 00:00:00",Anonymous,2007-01-01T12:00:00+0000,,0,0,2271,https://www.kismfoodmarkets.org/node/2271,no,IND
